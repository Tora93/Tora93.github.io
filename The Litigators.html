  <o:Description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partners at Finley &amp;amp; Figg&#8212;all two of them&#8212;often refer to themselves as ¡°a boutique law firm.¡± Boutique, as in chic, selective, and prosperous. They are, of course, none of these things. What they are is a two-bit operation always in search of their big break, ambulance chasers who¡¯ve been in the trenches much too long making way too little. Their specialties, so to speak, are quickie divorces and DUIs, with the occasional jackpot of an actual car wreck thrown in. After twenty plus years together, Oscar Finley and Wally Figg bicker like an old married couple but somehow continue to scratch out a half-decent living from their seedy bungalow offices in southwest Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then change comes their way. More accurately, it stumbles in. David Zinc, a young but already burned-out attorney, walks away from his fast-track career at a fancy downtown firm, goes on a serious bender, and finds himself literally at the doorstep of our boutique firm. Once David sobers up and comes to grips with the fact that he¡¯s suddenly unemployed, any job&#8212;even one with Finley &amp;amp; Figg&#8212;looks okay to him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their new associate on board, F&amp;amp;F is ready to tackle a really big case, a case that could make the partners rich without requiring them to actually practice much law. An extremely popular drug, Krayoxx, the number one cholesterol reducer for the dangerously overweight, produced by Varrick Labs, a giant pharmaceutical company with annual sales of $25 billion, has recently come under fire after several patients taking it have suffered heart attacks. Wally smells money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little online research confirms Wally¡¯s suspicions&#8212;a huge plaintiffs¡¯ firm in Florida is putting together a class action suit against Varrick. All Finley &amp;amp; Figg has to do is find a handful of people who have had heart attacks while taking Krayoxx, convince them to become clients, join the class action, and ride along to fame and fortune. With any luck, they won¡¯t even have to enter a courtroom! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It almost seems too good to be true. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it is.&lt;br&gt;&#10;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#10;The Litigators &lt;/em&gt;is a tremendously entertaining romp, filled with the kind of courtroom strategies, theatrics, and suspense that have made John Grisham America¡¯s favorite storyteller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read More&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</o:Description>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>The law firm of Finley &amp; Figg referred to
itself as a ¡°boutique firm.¡± This misnomer was inserted as often as possible
into routine conversations, and it even appeared in print in some of the
various schemes hatched by the partners to solicit business. When used
properly, it implied that Finley &amp; Figg was something above your average
two-bit operation. Boutique, as in small, gifted, and expert in one specialized
area. Boutique, as in pretty cool and chic, right down to the Frenchness of the
word itself. Boutique, as in thoroughly happy to be small, selective, and
prosperous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Except for its
size, it was none of these things. Finley &amp; Figg¡¯s scam was hustling injury
cases, a daily grind that required little skill or creativity and would never
be considered cool or sexy. Profits were as elusive as status. The firm was
small because it couldn¡¯t afford to grow. It was selective only because no one
wanted to work there, including the two men who owned it. Even its location
suggested a monotonous life out in the bush leagues. With a Vietnamese massage
parlor to its left and a lawn mower repair shop to its right, it was clear at a
casual glance that Finley &amp; Figg was not prospering. There was another
boutique firm directly across the street&#8212;hated rivals&#8212;and more lawyers around
the corner. In fact, the neighborhood was teeming with lawyers, some working
alone, others in small firms, others still in versions of their own little boutiques.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>F&amp;F¡¯s address
was on Preston Avenue, a busy street filled with <a name=page2></a>old
bungalows now converted and used for all manner of commercial activity. There
was retail (liquor, cleaners, massages) and professional (legal, dental, lawn
mower repair) and culinary (enchiladas, baklava, and pizza to go). Oscar Finley
had won the building in a lawsuit twenty years earlier. What the address lacked
in prestige it sort of made up for in location. Two doors away was the
intersection of Preston, Beech, and Thirty-eighth, a chaotic convergence of
asphalt and traffic that guaranteed at least one good car wreck a week, and
often more. F&amp;F¡¯s annual overhead was covered by collisions that happened
less than one hundred yards away. Other law firms, boutique and otherwise, were
often prowling the area in hopes of finding an available, cheap bungalow from
which their hungry lawyers could hear the actual squeal of tires and crunching
of metal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With only two
attorneys/partners, it was of course mandatory that one be declared the senior
and the other the junior. The senior partner was Oscar Finley, age sixty-two, a
thirty-year survivor of the bare-knuckle brand of law found on the tough
streets of southwest Chicago. Oscar had once been a beat cop but got himself
terminated for cracking skulls. He almost went to jail but instead had an
awakening and went to college, then law school. When no firms would hire him,
he hung out his own little shingle and started suing anyone who came near.
Thirty-two years later, he found it hard to believe that for thirty-two years
he¡¯d wasted his career suing for past-due accounts receivable, fender benders,
slip-and-falls, and quickie divorces. He was still married to his first wife, a
terrifying woman he wanted to sue every day for his own divorce. But he
couldn¡¯t afford it. After thirty-two years of lawyering, Oscar Finley couldn¡¯t
afford much of anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>His junior
partner&#8212;and Oscar was prone to say things like, ¡°I¡¯ll get my junior partner to
handle it,¡± when trying to impress judges and other lawyers and especially
prospective clients&#8212;was Wally Figg, age forty-five. Wally fancied himself a
hardball litigator, and his blustery ads promised all kinds of aggressive
behavior. ¡°We Fight for Your Rights!¡± and ¡°Insurance Companies Fear Us!¡± and
¡°We Mean Business!¡± Such ads could be seen on park benches, city transit buses,
cabs, high school <a name=page3></a>football programs, even telephone poles,
though this violated several ordinances. The ads were not seen in two crucial
markets&#8212;television and billboards. Wally and Oscar were still fighting over
these. Oscar refused to spend the money&#8212;both types were horribly expensive&#8212;and
Wally was still scheming. His dream was to see his smiling face and slick head
on television saying dreadful things about insurance companies while promising
huge settlements to injured folks wise enough to call his toll-free number.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But Oscar wouldn¡¯t
even pay for a billboard. Wally had one picked out. Six blocks from the office,
at the corner of Beech and Thirty-second, high above the swarming traffic, on
top of a four-story tenement house, there was the most perfect billboard in all
of metropolitan Chicago. Currently hawking cheap lingerie (with a comely ad,
Wally had to admit), the billboard had his name and face written all over it.
But Oscar still refused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally¡¯s law degree
came from the prestigious University of Chicago School of Law. Oscar picked his
up at a now-defunct place that once offered courses at night. Both took the bar
exam three times. Wally had four divorces under his belt; Oscar could only
dream. Wally wanted the big case, the big score with millions of dollars in
fees. Oscar wanted only two things&#8212;divorce and retirement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>How the two men
came to be partners in a converted house on Preston Avenue was another story.
How they survived without choking each other was a daily mystery.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Their
referee was Rochelle Gibson, a robust black woman with attitude and savvy
earned on the streets from which she came. Ms. Gibson handled the front&#8212;the
phone, the reception, the prospective clients arriving with hope and the
disgruntled ones leaving in anger, the occasional typing (though her bosses had
learned if they needed something typed, it was far simpler to do it
themselves), the firm dog, and, most important, the constant bickering between
Oscar and Wally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Years earlier, Ms.
Gibson had been injured in a car wreck that was <a name=page4></a>not her
fault. She then compounded her troubles by hiring the law firm of Finley &amp;
Figg, though not by choice. Twenty-four hours after the crash, bombed on
Percocet and laden with splints and plaster casts, Ms. Gibson had awakened to
the grinning, fleshy face of Attorney Wallis Figg hovering over her hospital
bed. He was wearing a set of aquamarine scrubs, had a stethoscope around his
neck, and was doing a good job of impersonating a physician. Wally tricked her
into signing a contract for legal representation, promised her the moon,
sneaked out of the room as quietly as he¡¯d sneaked in, then proceeded to
butcher her case. She netted $40,000, which her husband drank and gambled away
in a matter of weeks, which led to a divorce action filed by Oscar Finley. He
also handled her bankruptcy. Ms. Gibson was not impressed with either lawyer
and threatened to sue both for malpractice. This got their attention&#8212;they had
been hit with similar lawsuits&#8212;and they worked hard to placate her. As her
troubles multiplied, she became a fixture at the office, and with time the
three became comfortable with one another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Finley &amp; Figg
was a tough place for secretaries. The pay was low, the clients were generally
unpleasant, the other lawyers on the phone were rude, the hours were long, but
the worst part was dealing with the two partners. Oscar and Wally had tried the
mature route, but the older gals couldn¡¯t handle the pressure. They had tried youth
but got themselves sued for sexual harassment when Wally couldn¡¯t keep his paws
off a busty young thing. (They settled out of court for $50,000 and got their
names in the newspaper.) Rochelle Gibson happened to be at the office one
morning when the then-current secretary quit and stormed out. With the phone
ringing and partners yelling, Ms. Gibson moved over to the front desk and
calmed things down. Then she made a pot of coffee. She was back the next day,
and the next. Eight years later, she was still running the place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Her two sons were
in prison. Wally had been their lawyer, though in all fairness no one could
have saved them. As teenagers, both boys kept Wally busy with their string of
arrests on various drug charges. Their dealing got more involved, and Wally
warned them repeatedly <a name=page5></a>they were headed for prison, or death.
He said the same to Ms. Gibson, who had little control over the boys and often
prayed for prison. When their crack ring got busted, they were sent away for
ten years. Wally got it reduced from twenty and received no gratitude from the
boys. Ms. Gibson offered a tearful thanks. Through all their troubles, Wally
never charged her a fee for his representation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Over the years,
there had been many tears in Ms. Gibson¡¯s life, and they had often been shed in
Wally¡¯s office with the door locked. He gave advice and tried to help when
possible, but his greatest role was that of a listener. And with Wally¡¯s sloppy
life, the tables could be turned quickly. When his last two marriages blew up,
Ms. Gibson heard it all and offered encouragement. When his drinking picked up,
she saw it clearly and was not afraid to confront him. Though they fought
daily, their quarrels were always temporary and often contrived as a means of
protecting turf.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There were times at
Finley &amp; Figg when all three were snarling or sulking, and money was
usually the cause. The market was simply overcrowded; there were too many
lawyers loose on the streets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The last thing the
firm needed was another one.</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>David Zinc made it off the L train at the Quincy
Station in downtown Chicago, and he managed to shuffle down the steps that led
to Wells Street, but something was going wrong with his feet. They were getting
heavier and heavier, his steps slower and slower. He stopped at the corner of
Wells and Adams and actually looked at his shoes for a clue. Nothing, just the
same standard black leather lace-ups worn by every male lawyer in the firm, and
a couple of the females as well. His breathing was labored, and in spite of the
chill he felt moisture in his armpits. He was thirty-one years old, certainly
too young for a heart attack, and though he¡¯d been exhausted for the past five
years, he had learned to live with his fatigue. Or so he thought. He turned a
corner and looked at the Trust Tower, a glistening phallic monument jutting one
thousand feet upward into the clouds and fog. As he paused and looked up, his
heart rate quickened and he felt nauseous. Bodies touched him as they jostled
by. He crossed Adams in a pack and plodded on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The atrium of the
Trust Tower was tall and open, with plenty of marble and glass and
incomprehensible sculpture designed to inspire and provide warmth, when in
reality it seemed cold and forbidding, at least to David. Six escalators
crisscrossed each other and hauled hordes of weary warriors up to their
cubicles and offices. David tried, but his feet would not carry him to an
escalator. Instead, he sat on a leather bench beside a pile of large painted
rocks and tried to understand what <a name=page7></a>was happening to him.
People rushed by, grim-faced, hollow-eyed, stressed-out already, and it was
only 7:30 on this gloomy morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A ¡°snap¡± is
certainly not a medical term. Experts use fancier language to describe the
instant when a troubled person steps over the edge. Nonetheless, a snap is a
real moment. It can happen in a split second, the result of a terribly
traumatic event. Or it can be the final straw, the sad culmination of pressure
that builds and builds until the mind and body must find a release. David
Zinc¡¯s snap was of the latter variety. After five years of savage labor with
colleagues he loathed, something happened to David that morning as he sat by
the painted rocks and watched the well-dressed zombies ride upward to yet
another day of useless labor. He snapped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Hey Dave. You
going up?¡± someone was saying. It was Al, from antitrust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David managed to
smile and nod and mumble, then he stood and followed Al for some reason. Al was
a step ahead as they got onto an escalator, and he was talking about last
night¡¯s Blackhawks game. David kept nodding as they rose through the atrium.
Below him and following behind were dozens of lonely figures in dark overcoats,
other young lawyers rising, quiet and somber, much like pallbearers at a winter
funeral. David and Al joined a group at a wall of elevators on the first level.
As they waited, David listened to the hockey talk, but his head was spinning
and he was nauseous again. They rushed onto an elevator and stood shoulder to
shoulder with too many others. Silence. Al was quiet. No one spoke; no one made
eye contact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David said to
himself: ¡°This is it&#8212;my last ride in this elevator. I swear.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The elevator rocked
and hummed, then stopped at the eightieth floor, Rogan Rothberg territory.
Three lawyers got off, three faces David had seen before but didn¡¯t know by
name, which was not unusual because the firm had six hundred lawyers on floors
seventy through one hundred. Two more dark suits got off at eighty-four. As
they continued to rise, David began to sweat, then to hyperventilate. His tiny
office was on the ninety-third floor, and the closer he got, the <a name=page8></a>more
violently his heart pumped. More somber exits on ninety and ninety-one, and
with each stop David felt weaker and weaker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Only three were
left at ninety-three&#8212;David, Al, and a large woman who was called Lurch behind
her back. The elevator stopped, a bell chimed pleasantly, the door opened
silently, and Lurch stepped off. Al stepped off. David refused to move; in
fact, he couldn¡¯t move. Seconds passed. Al looked over his shoulder and said,
¡°Hey, David, this is us. Come on.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>No response from
David, just the blank, hollow gaze of someone in another world. The door began
to close, and Al jammed his briefcase in the opening. ¡°David, you okay?¡± Al
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure,¡± David
mumbled as he managed to move forward. The door slid open, the bell chimed
again. He was out of the elevator, looking around nervously as if he¡¯d never
before seen the place. In fact, he¡¯d left it only ten hours earlier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You look pale,¡± Al
said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David¡¯s head was
spinning. He heard Al¡¯s voice but didn¡¯t comprehend what he was saying. Lurch
was a few feet away, staring, puzzled, as if watching a car wreck. The elevator
pinged again, a different sound, and the door began to close. Al said something
else, even reached out a hand as if to help. Suddenly David spun and his leaden
feet came to life. He bolted for the elevator and made a diving reentry just as
the door slammed shut. The last thing he heard from the outside was Al¡¯s
panicked voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When the elevator
began its descent, David Zinc started to laugh. The spinning and nausea were
gone. The pressure on his chest vanished. He was doing it! He was leaving the
sweatshop of Rogan Rothberg and saying farewell to a nightmare. He, David Zinc,
of all the thousands of miserable associates and junior partners in the tall
buildings of downtown Chicago, he and he alone had found the spine to walk away
that gloomy morning. He sat on the floor in the empty elevator, watching with a
wide grin as the floor numbers zipped downward in bright red digital numbers,
and he fought to control his thoughts. The people: (1) his wife, a neglected
woman who wanted to get pregnant <a name=page9></a>but found it difficult
because her husband was too tired for sex; (2) his father, a prominent judge
who had basically forced him to go to law school, and not just anywhere but
Harvard Law School because that¡¯s where the judge had gone; (3) his
grandfather, the family tyrant who¡¯d built a mega firm from scratch in Kansas
City and still put in ten hours a day at the age of eighty-two; and (4) Roy
Barton, his supervising partner, his boss, a prickish crank who yelled and
cursed throughout the day and was perhaps the most miserable person David Zinc
had ever met. When he thought of Roy Barton, he laughed again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The elevator stopped
at the eightieth floor, and two secretaries started to enter. They paused
momentarily when confronted with David sitting in a corner, briefcase at his
side. Carefully, they stepped over his legs and waited for the door to close.
¡°Are you okay?¡± one asked. ¡°Fine,¡± David answered. ¡°And you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There was no
response. The secretaries stood rigid and quiet during the brief descent and
hustled off at seventy-seven. When David was alone again, he was suddenly
worried. What if they came after him? Al would no doubt go straight to Roy
Barton and report that Zinc had cracked up. What would Barton do? There was a
huge meeting at ten with an angry client, a big-shot CEO; in fact, as David
would think about things later, the showdown was probably the tipping point
that finally caused the Snap. Roy Barton was not only an abrasive prick but
also a coward. He needed David Zinc and others to hide behind when the CEO
marched in with a long list of valid complaints.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Roy might send
Security after him. Security was the usual contingent of aging uniformed door
guards, but it was also an in-house spy ring that changed locks, videoed
everything, moved in the shadows, and engaged in all manner of covert
activities designed to keep the lawyers in line. David jumped to his feet,
picked up his briefcase, and stared impatiently at the digital numbers blinking
by. The elevator rocked gently as it fell through the center of the Trust
Tower. When it stopped, David got off and darted to the escalators, which were
still packed with sad folks moving silently upward. The descending escalators
were unclogged, and David ran down one. Someone called out, <a name=page10></a>¡°Hey,
Dave, where are you going?¡± David smiled and waved in the general direction of
the voice, as if everything was under control. He strode past the painted rocks
and bizarre sculpture, and he eased his way through a glass door. He was
outside, and the air that had seemed so wet and dreary moments earlier now held
the promise of a new beginning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He took a deep
breath and looked around. Gotta keep moving. He began walking down LaSalle
Street, quickly, afraid to look over his shoulder. Don¡¯t look suspicious. Be
calm. This is now one of the most important days of your life, he told himself,
so don¡¯t blow it. He couldn¡¯t go home because he was not ready for that
confrontation. He couldn¡¯t walk the streets because he would bump into someone
he knew. Where could he hide for a while, think about things, clear his head,
make a plan? He checked his watch, 7:51, the perfect time for breakfast. Down
an alley he saw the red-and-green flashing neon sign of Abner¡¯s, and as he grew
closer, he couldn¡¯t tell if it was a caf&eacute; or a bar. At the door he glanced over
his shoulder, made sure Security was nowhere in sight, and entered the warm,
dark world of Abner¡¯s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was a bar. The
booths along the right were empty. The chairs were sitting upside down on the
tables, waiting for someone to clean the floor. Abner was behind the long,
well-polished wooden counter with a smirk on his face, as if to ask, ¡°What are
you doing here?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Are you open?¡±
David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Was the door
locked?¡± Abner shot back. He wore a white apron and was drying a beer mug. He
had thick, hairy forearms, and in spite of his gruff manner he had the trusting
face of a veteran bartender who¡¯d heard it all before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I guess not.¡±
David walked slowly to the bar, glanced to his right, and at the far end saw a
man who¡¯d apparently passed out, still holding a drink.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David removed his
charcoal-gray overcoat and hung it on the back of a stool. He took a seat,
looked at the rows of liquor bottles aligned in front of him, took in the
mirrors and beer taps and dozens of glasses <a name=page11></a>Abner had
arranged perfectly, and when he was settled, he said, ¡°What do you recommend
before eight o¡¯clock?¡± Abner looked at the man with his head on the counter and
said, ¡°How about coffee?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ve already had
that. Do you serve breakfast?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yep, it¡¯s called a
Bloody Mary.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll take one.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle
Gibson lived in a subsidized apartment with her mother, one of her daughters,
two of her grandchildren, varying combinations of nieces and nephews, and even
an occasional cousin in need of shelter. To escape the chaos, she often fled to
her workplace, though at times it was worse than home. She arrived at the
office each day around 7:30, unlocked the place, fetched both newspapers from
the porch, turned on the lights, adjusted the thermostat, made the coffee, and
checked on AC, the firm dog. She hummed and sometimes sang softly as she went
about her routine. Though she would never admit it to either of her bosses, she
was quite proud to be a legal secretary, even in a place like Finley &amp;
Figg. When asked her job or profession, she was always quick to state ¡°legal
secretary.¡± Never just a garden-variety secretary, but a legal one. What she
lacked in formal training she made up for in experience. Eight years in the
middle of a busy street practice had taught her a lot of law and even more
about lawyers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>AC was a mutt who
lived at the office because no one there was willing to take him home. He
belonged to the three&#8212;Rochelle, Oscar, and Wally&#8212;in equal shares, though
virtually all of the responsibilities of his care fell upon Rochelle. He was a
runaway who¡¯d chosen F&amp;F as his home several years earlier. Throughout the
day he slept on a small bed near Rochelle, and throughout the night he roamed
the office, guarding the place. He was a passable watchdog whose bark had
chased away burglars, vandals, and even several disgruntled clients.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle fed him
and filled his water bowl. From the small fridge <a name=page12></a>in the kitchen,
she removed a container of strawberry yogurt. When the coffee was ready, she
poured herself a cup and arranged things just so on her desk, which she kept in
immaculate order. It was glass and chrome, sturdy and impressive, the first
thing clients saw when they walked through the front door. Oscar¡¯s office was
somewhat tidy. Wally¡¯s was a landfill. They could hide their business behind
closed doors, but Rochelle¡¯s was in plain view.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She opened the <span
class=0Text>Sun-Times</span> and started with the front page. She read slowly,
sipping her coffee, eating her yogurt, humming softly while AC snored behind
her. Rochelle treasured these few quiet moments of the early morning. Before
long, the phone would start, the lawyers would appear, and then, if they were
lucky, clients would arrive, some with appointments, others without.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>To get away from
his wife, Oscar Finley left home each morning at seven, but he seldom got to
the office before nine. For two hours he moved around the city, stopping by a
police station where a cousin handled accident reports, dropping in to say
hello to tow truck drivers and catch the latest gossip on the most recent car
wrecks, drinking coffee with a man who owned two low-end funeral parlors,
taking doughnuts to a fire station and chatting with the ambulance drivers, and
occasionally making his rounds at his favorite hospitals, where he walked the
busy halls casting a trained eye for those injured by the negligence of others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar arrived at
nine. With Wally, whose life was far less organized, one never knew. He could
blow in at 7:30, fueled by caffeine and Red Bull and ready to sue anyone who
crossed him, or he could drag in at 11:00, puffy eyed, hungover, and soon
hiding in his office.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On
this momentous day, however, Wally arrived a few minutes before eight with a
big smile and clear eyes. ¡°Good morning, Ms. Gibson,¡± he said with conviction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good morning, Mr.
Figg,¡± she responded in similar fashion. At Finley &amp; Figg, the atmosphere
was always tense, with a fight just one <a name=page13></a>comment away. Words
were chosen carefully and received with scrutiny. The mundane early morning
salutes were cautiously handled because they could be a setup for an attack.
Even the use of ¡°Mr.¡± and ¡°Ms.¡± was contrived and loaded with history. Back
when Rochelle had been only a client, Wally had made the mistake of referring
to her as a ¡°girl.¡± It had been something like, ¡°Look, girl, I¡¯m doing the best
I can here.¡± He certainly meant no harm by it, and her overreaction was
uncalled for, but from that moment on she insisted on being addressed as ¡°Ms.
Gibson.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She was slightly
irritated because her solitude was interrupted. Wally spoke to AC and rubbed
his head, and as he headed for the coffee, he asked, ¡°Anything in the paper?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No,¡± she said, not
wanting to discuss the news.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No surprise
there,¡± he said, the first shot of the day. She read the <span class=0Text>Sun-Times</span>.
He read the <span class=0Text>Tribune</span>. Each considered the other¡¯s taste
in news to be rather low.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The second shot
came moments later when Wally reappeared. ¡°Who made the coffee?¡± he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She ignored this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s a bit weak,
don¡¯t you think?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She slowly turned a
page, then had some yogurt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally sipped
loudly, smacked his lips, frowned as though swallowing vinegar, then picked up
his newspaper and took a seat at the table. Before Oscar won the building in a
lawsuit, someone had knocked out several of the walls downstairs near the front
and created an open lobby area. Rochelle had her space on one side, near the
door, and a few feet away there were chairs for waiting clients and a long
table that was once used somewhere for dining purposes. Over the years, the
table had become the place where newspapers were read, coffee consumed, even
depositions taken. Wally liked to kill time there because his office was such a
pigsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He flung open his <span
class=0Text>Tribune</span> with as much noise as possible. Rochelle ignored him
and hummed away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A few minutes
passed, and the phone rang. Ms. Gibson seemed not <a name=page14></a>to hear
it. It rang again. After the third ring, Wally lowered his newspaper and said,
¡°You wanna get that, Ms. Gibson?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No,¡± she answered
shortly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It rang a fourth
time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And why not?¡± he
demanded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She ignored him.
After the fifth ring, Wally threw down his newspaper, jumped to his feet, and
headed for a phone on the wall near the copier. ¡°I wouldn¡¯t get that if I were
you,¡± Ms. Gibson said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He stopped. ¡°And
why not?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s a bill
collector.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How do you know?¡±
Wally stared at the phone. Caller ID revealed ¡°NAME UNKNOWN.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I just do. He
calls this time every week.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The phone went
silent, and Wally returned to the table and his newspaper. He hid behind it,
wondering which bill had not been paid, which supplier was irritated enough to
call a law office and put the squeeze on lawyers. Rochelle knew, of course,
because she kept the books and knew almost everything, but he preferred not to
ask her. If he did, then they would soon be bickering over the bills and unpaid
fees and lack of money in general, and this could easily spiral down into a
heated discussion about overall strategies of the firm, its future, and the
shortcomings of its partners.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Neither wanted
this.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Abner
took great pride in his Bloody Marys. He used precise amounts of tomato juice,
vodka, horseradish, lemon, lime, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, Tabasco, and
salt. He always added two green olives, then finished it with a stalk of
celery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It had been a long
time since David had enjoyed such a fine breakfast. After two of Abner¡¯s
creations, consumed rapidly, he was grinning goofily and proud of his decision
to chuck it all. The drunk at the end of the bar was snoring. There were no
other customers. Abner was a man about his business, washing and drying
cocktail glasses, taking <a name=page15></a>inventory of his booze, and
fiddling with the beer taps while offering commentary on a wide variety of
subjects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David¡¯s phone
finally rang. It was his secretary, Lana. ¡°Oh, boy,¡± he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who is it?¡± Abner
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The office.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A man¡¯s entitled
to breakfast, isn¡¯t he?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David grinned again
and said, ¡°Hello.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Lana said, ¡°David,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I have a watch,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Are you okay?

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David put down his

frowned and said, ¡°You might want to pace yourself.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°This thing has
ruled my life for the past five years. Can¡¯t go anywhere without it. Firm
policy. It stays with me at all times. It¡¯s interrupted nice dinners in
restaurants. It¡¯s dragged me out of the shower. It¡¯s woken me up at all hours
of the night. On one occasion it¡¯s interrupted sex with my poor neglected wife.
I was at a Cubs game last summer, great seats, me and two buddies from college,
top of the second inning, and this thing starts vibrating. It was Roy Barton.
Have I told you about Roy Barton?¡±</span></p>

all Big Men work nonstop. And Roy fancies himself a really Big Man.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>The phone rang again, and Rochelle decided to
answer it. ¡°The law firm of Finley &amp; Figg,¡± she said professionally. Wally
did not look up from his newspaper. She listened for a moment, then said, ¡°I¡¯m
sorry, but we do not handle real estate transactions.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When Rochelle
assumed her position eight years earlier, the firm did in fact handle real
estate transactions. However, she soon realized this type of work paid little
and relied heavily upon the secretary with almost no effort from the lawyers. A
quick study, she decided she disliked real estate. Because she controlled the
phone, she screened all calls, and the real estate section of Finley &amp; Figg
dried up. Oscar was outraged and threatened to fire her but backed down when
she mentioned, again, that she might sue them for legal malpractice. Wally
brokered a truce, but for weeks things were more tense than usual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Other specialties
had been cast aside under her diligent screening. Criminal work was history;
Rochelle didn¡¯t like it, because she didn¡¯t like the clients. DUIs were okay
because there were so many of them, they paid well, and they required almost no
involvement on her part. Bankruptcy bit the dust for the same reason that real
estate had&#8212;paltry fees and too much work for the secretary. Over the years
Rochelle had managed to streamline the firm¡¯s practice, and this was still
causing problems. Oscar¡¯s theory, one that had kept him broke for over thirty
years, was the firm should take everything that walked in the door, cast a wide
net, then pick through the debris in the hope of finding a good <a name=page18></a>injury
case. Wally disagreed. He wanted the big kill. Though he was forced by the
overhead to perform all sorts of mundane legal tasks, he was always dreaming of
ways to strike gold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Nice work,¡± he
said when she hung up. ¡°I never liked real estate.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She ignored this
and returned to her newspaper. AC began a low growl. When they looked at him,
he was standing on his small bed, nose tilted upward, tail straight and
pointing, eyes narrow with concentration. His growl grew louder, then, on cue,
the distant sound of an ambulance entered their solemn morning. Sirens never
failed to excite Wally, and for a second or two he froze as he skillfully
analyzed it. Police, fire, or ambulance? That was always the first issue, and
Wally could distinguish the three in a heartbeat. Sirens from fire trucks and
police cars meant nothing and were quickly ignored, but a siren from an
ambulance always quickened his pulse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Ambulance,¡± he
said, then placed his newspaper on the table, stood, and casually walked to the
front door. Rochelle also stood and walked to a window where she opened the
blinds for a quick look. AC was still growling, and when Wally opened the door
and stepped onto the front porch, the dog followed. Across the street, Vince
Gholston exited his own little boutique and cast a hopeful look at the
intersection of Beech and Thirty-eighth. When he saw Wally, he flipped him the
bird, and Wally quickly returned the greeting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The ambulance came
screaming down Beech, weaving and lurching its way through heavy traffic,
honking angrily, causing more havoc and danger than whatever awaited it. Wally watched
it until it was out of sight, then went inside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The newspaper
reading continued with no further interruptions&#8212;no sirens, no phone calls from
prospective clients or bill collectors. At 9:00 a.m., the door opened, and the
senior partner entered. As usual, Oscar wore a long dark overcoat and carried a
bulky black leather briefcase, as if he¡¯d been laboring away throughout the
night. He also carried his umbrella, as always, regardless of the weather or
forecast. Oscar toiled far away from the big leagues, but he could at least
look the part of a distinguished lawyer. Dark coats, dark suits, white shirts, <a
name=page19></a>and silk ties. His wife did the shopping and insisted that he
look the part. Wally, on the other hand, wore whatever he could pull from the
pile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Morning,¡± Oscar
said gruffly at Ms. Gibson¡¯s desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good morning,¡± she
replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Anything in the
newspaper?¡± Oscar was not interested in scores or floods or market reports or
the latest from the Middle East.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A forklift
operator got crushed in a plant out in Palos Heights,¡± Ms. Gibson responded
promptly. It was part of their morning ritual. If she did not find an accident
of some variety to brighten his morning, then his sour mood would only get
worse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I like it,¡± he
said. ¡°Is he dead?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not yet.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Even better. Lots
of pain and suffering. Make a note. I¡¯ll check it out later.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ms. Gibson nodded
as if the poor man were practically signed up as a new client. Of course, he
was not. Nor would he be. Finley &amp; Figg rarely got to the accident scene
first. Chances were the forklift operator¡¯s wife was already being hounded by
more aggressive lawyers, some of whom were known to offer cash and other
goodies to get the family on board.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Buoyed by this good
news, Oscar walked over to the table and said, ¡°Good morning.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Morning, Oscar,¡±
Wally said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Any of our clients
make the obituaries?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I haven¡¯t got that

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You should start

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thank you, Oscar.
Any more tips on how to read a newspaper?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar was already
walking away. Over his shoulder he asked Ms. Gibson, ¡°What¡¯s on my calendar for
today?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The usual.
Divorces and drunks.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Divorces and
drunks,¡± Oscar mumbled to himself as he stepped into his office. ¡°What I need
is a good car wreck.¡± He hung his overcoat on the back of the door, placed his
umbrella in a rack by his desk, and <a name=page20></a>began unpacking his
briefcase. Wally was soon standing nearby, holding the newspaper. ¡°Does the
name Chester Marino ring a bell?¡± he asked. ¡°Obit. Age fifty-seven, wife, kids,
grandkids, no cause given.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar scratched his
close-cropped gray hair and said, ¡°Maybe. Could¡¯ve been a last will and
testament.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°They got him down
at Van Easel &amp; Sons. Visitation tonight, service tomorrow. I¡¯ll snoop
around and see what¡¯s up. If he¡¯s one of ours, you wanna send flowers?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not until you know
the size of his estate.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good point.¡± Wally
was still holding his newspaper. ¡°This Taser thing is out of control, you know.
Cops in Joliet are accused of Tasering a seventy-year-old man who went to
Walmart to buy Sudafed for his sick grandchild. The pharmacist figured the old
man was using the stuff for a meth lab, so the pharmacist, being a good
citizen, called the cops. Turns out the cops all got themselves brand-new
Tasers, so five of these clowns stop the old man in the parking lot and Taser
his ass. Critical condition.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So we¡¯re back
doing Taser law, are we, Wally?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Damn right we are.
These are good cases, Oscar. We gotta get a few.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar sat down and
sighed heavily. ¡°So this week it¡¯s Taser guns. Last week it was diaper
rashes&#8212;big plans to sue the makers of Pampers because a few thousand babies
have diaper rashes. Last month it was Chinese drywall.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°They¡¯ve paid four
billion bucks already in the drywall class action.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, but we
haven¡¯t seen any of it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s my point,
Oscar. We have got to get serious about these mass tort cases. This is where
the money is. Millions in fees paid by companies that make billions in
profits.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The door was open,
and Rochelle was listening to every word, though this particular conversation
was getting a bit stale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was talking
louder. ¡°We get us a few of these cases, then <a name=page21></a>hook up with
the mass tort specialists, give them a piece of the cake, then ride their
coattails until they settle, and we walk away with a truckload. It¡¯s easy
money, Oscar.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Diaper rashes?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Okay, that didn¡¯t
work. But this Taser thing is a gold mine.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Another gold mine,
Wally?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yep, I¡¯ll prove
it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You do that.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The
drunk at the end of the bar had rallied somewhat. His head was up, his eyes
were partially open, and Abner was serving him coffee and chatting away, all in
an effort to convince the man it was time to leave. A teenager with a broom was
sweeping the floor and arranging tables and chairs. The little pub was showing
signs of life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With his brain
coated with vodka, David stared at himself in the mirror and tried in vain to
put things into perspective. One moment he was filled with excitement and proud
of his bold escape from the death march at Rogan Rothberg. The next moment he
was fearful for his wife, his family, his future. The booze gave him courage,
though, and he decided to keep drinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>His phone vibrated
again. It was Lana at the office. ¡°Hello,¡± he said quietly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°David, where are
you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A pause, then, ¡°Are

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Why don¡¯t you tell

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Abner was easing
over, curious to get the scoop on this latest phone call. He was rubbing the
wooden counter again, for the third or fourth time since David had planted
himself at the bar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The office,¡± David
said, and Abner frowned as if this were bad news for everyone. ¡°The

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Abner moved closer.
¡°Say, I never caught your name.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°David Zinc.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A pleasure. Look,

loaded with grease? French fries, onion rings, a big thick burger?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I want a double
order of onion rings and a large bottle of ketchup.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Attaboy.¡± Abner
disappeared. David drained his latest Bloody Mary and went to look for the
restroom. When he returned, he assumed his seat, checked the time&#8212;9:28&#8212;and
waited for the onion rings. He could smell them back there somewhere sizzling
in hot oil. The drunk to his far right was gulping coffee and struggling to
keep his eyes open. The teenager was still sweeping floors and arranging
furniture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The phone vibrated
on the counter. It was his wife. David made no move to answer it. When the
vibrating was over, he waited, then checked the voice mail. Helen¡¯s message was
about what he expected: ¡°David, your office has called twice. Where are you?
What are you <a name=page23></a>doing? Everyone is very worried. Are you all
right? Call me as soon as possible.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She was a doctoral
student at Northwestern, and when he had kissed her good-bye that morning at
6:45, she was still under the covers. When he arrived home the night before at
10:05, they had dined on leftover lasagna in front of the television before he
fell asleep on the sofa. Helen was two years older and wanted to get pregnant,
something that was looking more and more unlikely given her husband¡¯s perpetual
exhaustion. In the meantime, she was pursuing a Ph.D. in art history, and doing
so at a leisurely pace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A soft beep, then a
text message from her: ¡°Where are you? Are you okay? Please.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He preferred not to
speak to her for several hours. He would be forced to admit he was cracking up,
and she would insist he get professional help. Her father was a shrink and her
mother was a marriage counselor, and the entire family believed that all of
life¡¯s problems and mysteries could be solved with a few hours in therapy. At
the same time, though, he couldn¡¯t stand the thought that she was frantically
worrying about his safety.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He sent a text:
¡°I¡¯m fine. I had to leave the office for a while. I¡¯ll be okay. Please don¡¯t

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She replied: ¡°Where

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The onion rings
arrived, a huge pile of golden-brown circles covered in thick batter and
grease, hot from the fryer. Abner placed them in front of David and said,
¡°These are the best. How about a glass of water?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I was thinking
about a pint of beer.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You got it.¡± Abner

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sorry. She¡¯s a

ten at night. That¡¯s a typical day, but it¡¯s not unusual to work past midnight.
So when I get home, I crash. I think we had sex once last month. Hard to
believe. I¡¯m thirty-one. She¡¯s thirty-three. Both in our prime and wanting to
get pregnant, and big boy here can¡¯t stay awake.¡± He opened the bottle of
ketchup and unloaded a third of it. Abner placed a frosty pint of lager in
front of him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°At least you¡¯re
making plenty of dough,¡± Abner said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David peeled off an
onion ring, dipped it in ketchup, and stuffed it in his mouth. ¡°Oh, sure, they
pay me. Why would I subject myself to such abuse if I weren¡¯t getting paid?¡±
David glanced around to make sure no one was listening. No one was there. He
lowered his voice as he ground away on the onion ring, and said, ¡°I¡¯m a senior
associate, five years in, my gross last year was three hundred K. That¡¯s a lot
of money, and since I don¡¯t have time to spend it, it¡¯s just piling up in the
bank. But look at the math. I worked four thousand hours but billed only three
thousand. Three thousand hours, tops in the firm. The rest of it got lost in
firm activities and pro bono work. Are you with me, Abner? You look bored.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m listening.
I¡¯ve served lawyers before. I know how dull they are.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David took a long
swig of lager and smacked his lips. ¡°I appreciate your bluntness.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Just doing my

and you understand why law schools are packed with bright young students who

stuffed another large one into his parched mouth, then washed it down with half
a pint. There was a loud thud at the end of the bar. The drunk down there
succumbed once again. His head was on the counter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who¡¯s the guy?¡±
David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°His name¡¯s Eddie.
His brother owns half of the place, so he runs a tab that never gets paid. I¡¯m
sick of the guy.¡± Abner eased away and spoke to Eddie, who didn¡¯t respond.
Abner removed the coffee cup and wiped the counter around Eddie, then slowly
made his way back to David.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So you¡¯re walking
away from three hundred grand,¡± Abner said. ¡°What¡¯s the plan?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David laughed, much
too loud. ¡°A plan? Haven¡¯t got that far. Two hours ago I reported for work as

a long time and try to analyze my crack-up. Will you help me?¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>After an hour or so of reading the newspaper,
eating her yogurt, and enjoying her coffee, Rochelle Gibson reluctantly went to
work. Her first task was to check the client register for one Chester Marino,
now resting quietly in a modestly priced bronze casket at Van Easel &amp; Sons
Funeral Home. Oscar was right. The firm had prepared a last will and testament
for Mr. Marino six years earlier. She found the thin file in the storage room
next to the kitchen and took it to Wally, who was hard at work amid the debris
on his desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The office of
Wallis T. Figg, Attorney and Counselor-at-Law, had been a bedroom in the
original scheme of things, but over the years, as walls and doors were
reconfigured, the square footage had been expanded somewhat. It certainly gave
no hint of once being a bedroom, but then it didn¡¯t much resemble an office
either. It began at the door with walls no more than twelve feet apart, then
doglegged to the right, to a larger space where Wally worked behind a
1950s-style faux-modern desk he¡¯d snapped up at a fire sale. The desk was
covered with stacks of manila files and used legal pads and hundreds of phone
message slips, and to anyone who didn¡¯t know better, including prospective
clients, the desk gave the impression that the man behind it was extremely
busy, maybe even important.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As always, Ms.
Gibson walked slowly toward the desk, careful not to upset the piles of thick
law books and old files stacked along <a name=page27></a>the route. She handed
him the file and said, ¡°We did a will for Mr. Marino.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thanks. Any
assets?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I didn¡¯t look,¡±
she said, already backtracking. She left without another word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally opened the
file. Six years earlier, Mr. Marino was working as an auditor for the State of Illinois,
earning $70,000 a year, living with his second wife and her two teenagers, and
enjoying a quiet life in the suburbs. He had just paid off the mortgage on
their home, which was their only significant asset. They had joint bank
accounts, retirement funds, and few debts. The only interesting wrinkle was a
collection of three hundred baseball cards that Mr. Marino valued at $90,000.
On page 4 of the file, there was a Xerox copy of a 1916 card of Shoeless Joe
Jackson in a White Sox uniform, and under it Oscar had written: $75,000. Oscar
cared nothing for sports, and he had never mentioned this little oddity to
Wally. Mr. Marino signed a simple will he could have prepared himself for free,
but instead paid Finley &amp; Figg $250 for the honors. As Wally read the will,
he realized its only real purpose, since all other assets were jointly owned,
was to make sure his two stepchildren didn¡¯t get their hands on his baseball
card collection. Mr. Marino left it to his son, Lyle. On page 5, Oscar had
scribbled: ¡°Wife doesn¡¯t know about cards.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally estimated the
value of the estate at somewhere in the $500,000 range, and under the probate
scheme currently in place the lawyer handling Mr. Marino¡¯s final affairs would
earn about $5,000. Unless there was a fight over the baseball cards, and Wally
certainly hoped there would be, the probate would be painfully routine and take
about eighteen months. But if the heirs fought, then Wally could drag it out
for three years and triple his fee. He did not like probate work, but it was
far better than divorce and child custody. Probate paid the bills, and
occasionally it led to additional fees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The fact that
Finley &amp; Figg prepared the will meant nothing when it was time to probate
it. Any lawyer could do so, and Wally knew <a name=page28></a>from his vast
experience in the murky world of client solicitation that there were scores of
hungry lawyers poring over obituaries and calculating fees. It was worth his
time to check on Chester and lay claim to the legal work necessary in tidying
up his affairs. It was certainly worth a drive-by at Van Easel &amp; Sons, one
of many funeral homes on his circuit.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Three
months remained on the suspension of Wally¡¯s driver¡¯s license for drunken
driving, but he drove nonetheless. He was careful, though, keeping to the streets
near his home and office where he knew the cops. When he went to court
downtown, he took the bus or the train.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Van Easel &amp;
Sons was a few blocks outside his comfort zone, but he decided to roll the
dice. If he got caught, he could probably talk his way out of trouble. If the
police didn¡¯t budge, then he knew the judges. He used the backstreets as much
as possible and stayed away from the traffic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Mr. Van Easel and
his three sons had been dead for many years, and as their funeral parlor passed
from one owner to another, the business had declined, as had the ¡°loving and
thoughtful service¡± that was still advertised. Wally parked in the rear, in an
empty lot, and walked through the front door as if he were there to pay his
respects. It was almost 10:00 a.m., on a Wednesday morning, and for a few
seconds he saw no one else. He paused in the lobby and looked at the visiting
schedule. Chester was two doors down on the right, in the second of three
visiting rooms. To the left was a small chapel. A man with pasty skin, brown
teeth, and a black suit approached and said, ¡°Good morning. May I help you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good morning, Mr.
Grayber,¡± Wally said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh, it¡¯s you
again.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Always a
pleasure.¡± Though Wally had once shaken hands with Mr. Grayber, he made no
effort to do so again. He wasn¡¯t sure, but he suspected him to be one of the
morticians. He had always remembered <a name=page29></a>the soft, chilly touch
of his palm. And Mr. Grayber kept his palms to himself as well. Each man
disliked the other¡¯s profession.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Mr. Marino was a
client,¡± Wally said gravely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°His visitation is
not until this evening,¡± Grayber said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, I see that.
But I¡¯m leaving town this afternoon.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Very well.¡± He
sort of waved in the direction of the viewing rooms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t suppose
any other lawyers have stopped by,¡± Wally said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Grayber snorted and
rolled his eyes. ¡°Who knows? I can¡¯t keep up with you people. We had a service
last week for an illegal Mexican, got himself pinned under a bulldozer, used
the chapel there,¡± he said, nodding at the chapel door. ¡°We had more lawyers
here than family members. Poor guy¡¯s never been so loved.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How nice,¡± Wally
said. He had attended the service last week. Finley &amp; Figg did not get the
case. ¡°Thanks,¡± he said and walked away. He passed the first viewing
room&#8212;closed casket, no mourners. He stepped into the second, a dimly lit room,
twenty feet by twenty, with a casket along one wall and cheap chairs lining the
others. Chester was sealed up, which pleased Wally. He put his hand on the
casket as if fighting back tears. Just he and Chester, sharing one last moment
together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The routine here
was to hang around for a few minutes and hope a family member or friend showed
up. If not, then Wally would sign the register and leave his card with Grayber
with specific instructions to tell the family that Mr. Marino¡¯s lawyer stopped
by to pay his respects. The firm would send flowers to the service and a letter
to the widow, and in a few days Wally would call the woman and act as though
she were somehow obligated to hire Finley &amp; Figg because they had prepared
the will. This worked about half the time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was leaving
when a young man entered the room. He was about thirty, nice looking,
reasonably dressed with a jacket and tie. He looked at Wally with a great deal
of skepticism, which was the way a lot of people initially viewed him, though
this no longer bothered him. When two perfect strangers meet at a casket in an
empty viewing <a name=page30></a>room, the first words are always awkward.
Wally finally managed to state his name, and the young man said, ¡°Yes, well, uh,
that¡¯s my father. I¡¯m Lyle Marino.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ah, soon-to-be
owner of a nice collection of baseball cards. But Wally could not mention this.
¡°Your father was a client of my law firm,¡± Wally said. ¡°We prepared his last
will and testament. I¡¯m very sorry.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thanks,¡± Lyle
said, and seemed relieved. ¡°I can¡¯t believe this. We went to the Blackhawks
game last Saturday. Had a great time. Now he¡¯s gone.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m very sorry. So
it was sudden?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A heart attack.¡±
Lyle snapped his fingers and said, ¡°Just like that. He was at work Monday
morning, at his desk, all of a sudden he started sweating and breathing hard,
then he just fell on the floor. Dead.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m very sorry,
Lyle,¡± Wally said as if he¡¯d known the young man forever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Lyle was patting
the top of the casket and repeating, ¡°I just can¡¯t believe this.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally needed to
fill in some blanks. ¡°Your parents divorced about ten years ago, right?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Something like
that.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Is your mother
still in the city?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes.¡± Lyle wiped
his eyes with the back of his hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And your stepmother.
Are you close to her?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No. We don¡¯t
speak. The divorce was ugly.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally suppressed a
smile. A feuding family would run up his fees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m sorry. Her
name is ¡¦¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Millie.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Right. Look, Lyle,
I gotta run. Here¡¯s my card.¡± Wally deftly whipped out a business card and
handed it over. ¡°Chester was a great guy,¡± Wally said. ¡°Call us if we can
help.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Lyle took the card
and stuffed it into his pants pocket. He was staring blankly at the casket.
¡°I¡¯m sorry, what¡¯s your name?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Figg, Wally Figg.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page31></a><span lang=EN>¡°And
you¡¯re a lawyer?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes. Finley &amp;
Figg, a small boutique firm with lots of business in all major courts.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And you knew my
father?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh yes, very well.
He loved to collect baseball cards.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Lyle took his hand
off the casket and looked square into the shifty eyes of Wally Figg. ¡°You know
what killed my father, Mr. Figg?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You said it was a
heart attack.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Right. You know
what caused the heart attack?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, no.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Lyle glanced at the
door to make sure they were still alone. He glanced around the room to make sure
no one could possibly be listening. He took a step closer so that his shoes
were almost touching those of Wally, who by now was expecting to hear that old
Chester had been murdered in some clever fashion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In a near whisper,
Lyle asked, ¡°Ever hear of a drug called Krayoxx?¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There
was a McDonald¡¯s in the shopping center next to Van Easel¡¯s. Wally bought two
cups of coffee, and they huddled in a booth, as far away from the counter as
possible. Lyle had a stack of papers&#8212;articles pulled from the Internet&#8212;and it
was obvious he needed someone to talk to. Since his father¡¯s death forty-eight
hours earlier, he had become obsessed with Krayoxx.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The drug had been
on the market for six years, and its sales had grown rapidly. In most cases, it
lowered the cholesterol of obese people. Chester¡¯s weight had slowly climbed
toward three hundred pounds, and this had caused other increases&#8212;blood pressure
and cholesterol, to name the most obvious. Lyle had hounded his father about
his weight, but Chester couldn¡¯t stay away from the midnight ice cream. His way
of handling the stress of the ugly divorce was to sit in the dark and knock out
one pint after another of Ben &amp; Jerry¡¯s. Once the weight was on, he
couldn¡¯t get it off. His doctor prescribed Krayoxx a year earlier, and his
cholesterol dropped dramatically. At the same time, he <a name=page32></a>began
complaining of an irregular heart rate and shortness of breath. He reported
these to his doctor, who assured him there was nothing wrong. The dramatic dip
in his cholesterol far outweighed any of these minor side effects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Krayoxx was made by
Varrick Labs, a New Jersey firm currently number three on Big Pharma¡¯s list of
the world¡¯s ten largest drug companies, annual sales of some $25 billion, and a
long, ugly history of bruising battles with federal regulators and tort
lawyers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Varrick makes six
billion a year off Krayoxx,¡± Lyle was saying as he sifted through research.
¡°With an annual increase of 10 percent.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally ignored his
coffee as he scanned a report. He listened silently, though the wheels were
turning so fast he was almost dizzy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And here¡¯s the
best part,¡± Lyle said, picking up another sheet of paper. ¡°Ever hear of a law
firm called Zell &amp; Potter?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally had never
heard of Krayoxx, though at 240 pounds and with a slightly elevated cholesterol
he was mildly surprised his doctor had not mentioned the drug. Nor had he heard
of Zell &amp; Potter, but, sensing they were major players in something
important, he wasn¡¯t about to admit his ignorance. ¡°I think so,¡± he said,
frowning, searching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Big plaintiffs¡¯
firm in Fort Lauderdale.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yep.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°They filed suit in
Florida last week against Varrick, a huge lawsuit for wrongful deaths caused by
Krayoxx. Here¡¯s the story in the <span class=0Text>Miami Herald</span>.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally scanned the
story as his heart rate doubled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m sure you heard
about this lawsuit,¡± Lyle said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was
constantly amazed at the na&iuml;vet&eacute; of the average guy. Over two million lawsuits
are filed in the United States each year, and poor Lyle here was thinking that
Wally had noticed one filed in south Florida. ¡°Yep, I¡¯ve been watching this
one,¡± Wally said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Does your firm
handle cases like this?¡± Lyle asked, so innocently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s our
specialty,¡± Wally said. ¡°We cut our teeth on injury and death cases. I¡¯d love
to go after Varrick Labs.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You would? Have
you ever sued them before?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page33></a><span lang=EN>¡°No,
but we¡¯ve gone after most of the major drug companies.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°This is great.
Then you¡¯re willing to take my dad¡¯s case?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Damn right I¡¯ll
take it, Wally thought, but through years of experience he knew not to rush in.
Or at least not to seem overly optimistic. ¡°Let¡¯s just say the case has real
potential. I¡¯ll need to confer with my senior partner, do some research, chat
with the boys down at Zell &amp; Potter, do my homework. Mass tort work is very
complicated.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And it could also
be insanely lucrative, which was Wally¡¯s primary thought at the moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thank you, Mr.
Figg.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At
five minutes before eleven, Abner became somewhat animated. He began watching
the door as he continued shining martini glasses with his white towel. Eddie
was awake again, sipping coffee but still in another world. Finally, Abner
said, ¡°Say, David, could you do me a favor?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Anything.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Could you move two

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David looked to his
right&#8212;there were eight empty stools between him and Eddie. And to his left
there were seven empty stools between him and the other end of the bar. ¡°Are
you kidding?¡± David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Come on.¡± Abner
grabbed his pint of beer, which was almost empty, replaced it with a full one,
and situated everything two stools to the left. David slowly lifted himself up
and followed his beer. ¡°What¡¯s the deal?¡± he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯ll see,¡± Abner
said, nodding at the door. There was no one else in the pub, other than, of
course, Eddie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Minutes later, the door
opened, and an elderly Asian man appeared. He wore a dapper uniform, a bow tie,
and a little driver¡¯s cap. He was helping a lady much older than himself. She
walked with a cane, unassisted but with the driver hovering, and the two of
them shuffled across the floor toward the bar. David watched with
fascination&#8212;was <a name=page34></a>he finally seeing things, or was this for
real? Abner was mixing a drink and watching too. Eddie was mumbling to himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good morning, Miss
Spence,¡± Abner said politely, almost with a bow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good morning,
Abner,¡± she said as she slowly lifted herself up and delicately mounted the
stool. Her driver followed her movements with both hands but didn¡¯t touch her.
Once she was properly seated, she said, ¡°I¡¯ll have the usual.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The driver nodded
at Abner, then backed away and quietly left the bar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Miss Spence was
wearing a full-length mink coat, thick pearls around her tiny neck, and layers
of thick rouge and mascara that did little to hide the fact that she was at
least ninety years old. David admired her immediately. His own grandmother was
ninety-two and strapped to a bed in a nursing home, absent from this world, and
here was this grand old dame boozing it up before lunch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She ignored him.
Abner finished mixing her drink, a baffling combination of ingredients. ¡°One
Pearl Harbor,¡± he said as he presented it to her. She slowly lifted it to her
mouth, took a small sip with her eyes closed, swirled the booze around her
mouth, then offered Abner the slightest of heavily wrinkled grins. He seemed to
breathe again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David, not quite
plastered but well on his way, leaned over and said, ¡°Come here often?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Abner gulped and
showed both palms to David. ¡°Miss Spence is a regular, and she prefers to drink
in silence,¡± he said, panicky. Miss Spence was taking another sip, again with
her eyes closed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She wants to drink
in silence in a bar?¡± David asked in disbelief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes!¡± Abner
snapped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, I guess she
picked the right bar,¡± David said, flopping an arm around and taking in the
emptiness of the pub. ¡°This place is deserted. Do you ever have a crowd around
here?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Quiet,¡± Abner
urged. His face said, ¡°Just be cool for a while.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But David kept on.
¡°I mean, you¡¯ve had just two customers all <a name=page35></a>morning, me and
old Eddie down there, and we all know that he doesn¡¯t pay his tab.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At the moment,
Eddie was lifting his coffee cup in the general direction of his face but was
having trouble finding his mouth. Evidently, he did not hear David¡¯s comment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Knock it off,¡±
Abner growled. ¡°Or I¡¯ll ask you to leave.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sorry,¡± David said
and went silent. He had no desire to leave because he had no idea where to go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The third sip did
the trick and loosened things up a little. Miss Spence opened her eyes and
looked around. Slowly, and with an ancient voice, she said, ¡°Yes, I come here often.
Monday through Saturday. And you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°My first visit,¡±
David said, ¡°but I doubt it¡¯s my last. After today, I¡¯ll probably have more
time to drink and more reasons for doing so. Cheers.¡± He leaned across with his
pint of lager and ever so carefully touched her glass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Cheers,¡± she said.
¡°And why are you here, young man?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s a long story,
and getting longer. Why are you here?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh, I don¡¯t know.
Habit, I guess. Six days a week for how long, Abner?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°At least twenty
years.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She apparently did
not want to hear David¡¯s long story. She took another sip and looked as though
she wanted to nod off. David was suddenly sleepy too.</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Helen Zinc arrived at the Trust Tower a few
minutes after noon. Driving downtown, she had tried to call and text her husband
for the umpteenth time, with no recent success. At 9:33 he had sent her a text
message instructing her not to worry, and at 10:42 he¡¯d sent his second and
final text, in which he had said: ¡°No swaet. Am ok. Don¡¯t wory.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Helen parked in a
garage, hurried down the street, and entered the atrium of the building.
Minutes later she stepped off the elevator on the ninety-third floor. A
receptionist led her to a small conference room where she waited alone. Though
it was lunchtime, the Rogan Rothberg culture frowned on anyone leaving the
building to eat. Good food and fresh air were almost taboo. Occasionally, one
of the big partners would take a client out for a splashy marathon, an
expensive lunch that the client would ultimately pay for through the time-honored
tricks of file padding and fee gouging, but as a general rule&#8212;though
unwritten&#8212;the associates and lesser partners grabbed a quick sandwich from a
machine. On a typical day, David had both breakfast and lunch at his desk, and
it was not unusual to have dinner there as well. He once bragged to Helen he
had billed three different clients an hour each as he shoved down a smoked tuna
with chips and a diet soda. She hoped he was only joking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Though she wasn¡¯t
sure of the exact number, he had put on at least thirty pounds since their
wedding day. He ran marathons back then, and the extra weight was not a problem
yet. But the steady diet of bad <a name=page37></a>food along with a
near-complete absence of exercise worried both of them. At Rogan Rothberg, the
hour between 12:00 and 1:00 was no different from any other hour of the day or
night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was Helen¡¯s
second visit to the office in five years. Spouses were not excluded, but they
were not invited either. There was no reason for her to be there, and, given
the avalanche of horror stories he brought home, she had no desire to see the
place or spend time with the people. Twice a year she and David dragged
themselves to some dreadful Rogan Rothberg social gathering, some miserable
outing designed to foster camaraderie among the battered lawyers and their
neglected spouses. Invariably, these turned into sloppy drinking parties with
behavior that was embarrassing and impossible to forget. Take a bunch of
exhausted lawyers, ply them with booze, and things get ugly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A year earlier, on
a party boat a mile out on Lake Michigan, Roy Barton had tried to grope her. If
he hadn¡¯t been so drunk, he may have succeeded, and that would have caused
serious problems. For a week she and David argued about what to do. David
wanted to confront him, then complain to the firm¡¯s Standards Committee. Helen
said no, it would only harm David¡¯s career. There were no witnesses, and the
truth was that Barton probably didn¡¯t remember what he¡¯d done. With time, they
stopped talking about the incident. After five years she had heard so many Roy
Barton stories that David refused to mention his boss¡¯s name at home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Suddenly there he
was. Roy walked into the small conference room with a snarl on his face and
demanded, ¡°Helen, what¡¯s going on here?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Funny, I have the
same question,¡± she shot back. Mr. Barton, as he preferred to be called, ran
over people by barking first and trying to embarrass. She would have none of
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Where is he?¡± he
barked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You tell me, Roy,¡±
she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Lana, the
secretary, and Al and Lurch appeared together, as if they¡¯d been subpoenaed by
the same marshal. Quick introductions were made as Roy closed the door. Helen
had spoken to Lana many times on the phone but had never met her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page38></a><span lang=EN>Roy
looked at Al and Lurch and said, ¡°You two, tell us exactly what happened.¡± They
tag-teamed through their version of David Zinc¡¯s last elevator ride and without
the slightest bit of embellishment presented a fairly clear picture of a
troubled man who¡¯d simply snapped. He was sweating, breathing hard, pale, and
he actually dived headfirst back into the elevator, landing on its floor, and,
just as the door closed, they heard him laughing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He was fine when
he left home this morning,¡± Helen assured them, as if to emphasize the point
that the crack-up was the firm¡¯s fault and not hers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You,¡± Roy barked
in the direction of Lana. ¡°You¡¯ve talked to him.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Lana had her notes.
She had spoken to him twice, then he stopped answering the phone. ¡°In the
second conversation,¡± she said, ¡°I got the clear impression that he was
drinking. His tongue was a bit thick; his syllables were not as sharp.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Roy glared at Helen
as if she were to blame.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Where would he
go?¡± Roy demanded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh, the usual
place, Roy,¡± Helen said. ¡°The same place he always goes when he cracks up at
7:30 in the morning and gets plastered.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There was a heavy
pause in the room. Evidently, Helen Zinc felt free to sass Mr. Barton, but the
others certainly did not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In a lower tone,
Mr. Barton asked her, ¡°Is he drinking too much?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He doesn¡¯t have
time to drink, Roy. He comes home at ten or eleven, sometimes has a glass of
wine, then he¡¯s out on the sofa.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Is he seeing a
shrink?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°For what? Working
a hundred hours a week? I thought that was the norm around here. I think all of
you people need to see a shrink.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Another pause. Roy
was getting his ass handed to him, and this was very unusual. Al and Lurch
stared at the table and worked hard to conceal grins. Lana was a deer in
headlights, ready to be fired on the spot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So you have no
information that might help us here?¡± Roy said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page39></a><span lang=EN>¡°No,
and evidently you have no information to help me either, right, Roy?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Roy had had enough.
His eyes narrowed, his jaws clenched, his face turned red. He looked at Helen
and said, ¡°He¡¯ll show up, okay, sooner or later. He¡¯ll get in a cab and find
his way home. He¡¯ll crawl back to you, and then he¡¯ll crawl back to us. He gets
one more chance, you understand? I want him in my office tomorrow morning at
8:00 sharp. Sober, and sorry.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Helen¡¯s eyes were
suddenly wet. She touched both cheeks and, in a cracking voice, said, ¡°I just
want to find him. I want to know he¡¯s safe. Can you help me?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Start looking,¡±
Roy said. ¡°There are a thousand bars in downtown Chicago. You¡¯ll find him
sooner or later.¡± And with that Roy Barton made a dramatic exit from the room,
slamming the door behind him. As soon as he was gone, Al stepped forward,
touched Helen on the shoulder, and said softly, ¡°Look, Roy¡¯s an asshole, but
he¡¯s right about one thing. David¡¯s in a bar getting drunk. He¡¯ll eventually
get in a cab and go home.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Lurch stepped
closer too and said, ¡°Helen, this has happened before around here. In fact,
it¡¯s not that unusual. He¡¯ll be fine tomorrow.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And the firm has a
counselor on the payroll, a real pro who deals with casualties,¡± Al added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A casualty?¡± Helen
asked. ¡°Is that what my husband is at this point?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Lurch shrugged and
said, ¡°Yes, but he¡¯ll be okay.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Al shrugged and
said, ¡°He¡¯s in a bar. I¡¯d love to be with him.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At
Abner¡¯s, the lunch crowd had finally arrived. The booths and tables were full,
and the bar was packed with office workers washing down burgers with pints of
beer. David had moved one stool to his right so that he was now next to Miss
Spence. She was on her third and last Pearl Harbor. David was on his second.
When she offered him his <a name=page40></a>first, he had initially declined,
claiming he had no taste for fussy mixed drinks. She insisted, and Abner
whipped one up and slid it in front of David. Though it looked as harmless as
cough syrup, the drink was a lethal combination of vodka, melon liqueur, and
pineapple juice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They found common
ground at Wrigley Field. Miss Spence¡¯s father had taken her there as a small
girl, and she had followed her beloved Cubs her entire life. She had held
season tickets for sixty-two years, a record, she was certain, and she had seen
the great ones&#8212;Rogers Hornsby, Ernie Banks, Ron Santo, Billy Williams, Fergie
Jenkins, and Ryne Sandberg. And she had suffered greatly, along with all Cubs
fans. Her eyes danced as she told the well-known story of the Curse of the
Billy Goat. Her eyes moistened when she remembered, in detail, the Great Fall
of 1969. She took a long sip after recounting the infamous June Swoon of 1977.
She let it slip that her late husband had once tried to buy the team but was
somehow outmaneuvered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After two Pearl
Harbors, she was fairly smashed. The third was putting her away. She had no
curiosity about David¡¯s situation; rather, she preferred to do most of the
talking, and David, who was in slow motion, was content to just sit and listen.
Abner ventured by occasionally, making sure she was happy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At precisely 12:15,
just as Abner¡¯s lunch business hit full stride, her Asian driver arrived to
collect her. She drained her glass, said good-bye to Abner, made no effort to
pay a tab, thanked David for the company, and left the bar, her left hand
tucked inside her driver¡¯s elbow and her right hand working the cane. Her walk
was slow, but erect, proud. She¡¯d be back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who was that?¡±
David asked Abner when he got close enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll tell you
later. You having lunch?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure. Those
burgers look good. Double cheese, with fries.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You got it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The
cabdriver¡¯s name was Bowie, and he was a talker. As they left the third funeral
home, his curiosity could no longer be restrained. <a name=page41></a>¡°Say,
pal, I gotta ask,¡± he chirped over his shoulder. ¡°What¡¯s with all these funeral
homes?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally had covered
the rear seat in obituary pages, city maps, and legal pads. ¡°Let¡¯s head over to
Wood &amp; Ferguson on 103rd Street near Beverly Park,¡± he said, temporarily
ignoring Bowie¡¯s question. They had been together for almost two hours, and the
meter was approaching $180, a nice chunk in terms of cab fare but chump change
in the context of Krayoxx litigation. According to some of the news articles
Lyle Marino had given him, the lawyers were speculating that a wrongful death
case involving the drug could potentially be worth $2 to $4 million. The
lawyers would take 40 percent, and Finley &amp; Figg would, of course, have to
share their fee with Zell &amp; Potter or another tort firm spearheading the
litigation. Still, after all the fee splitting, the drug was a gold mine. The
urgent issue was finding the cases. As they rushed around Chicago, Wally was
confident he was the only lawyer out of a million in the city who was, at that
moment, shrewd enough to be combing the streets in search of Krayoxx victims.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>According to
another article, the drug¡¯s dangers had just been discovered. And another one,
quoting a trial lawyer, said that the medical community and the public in
general were not yet aware of the ¡°Krayoxx fiasco.¡± But Wally was now aware,
and he didn¡¯t care how much he spent on cab fare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I was asking about
all these funeral homes,¡± Bowie chirped again. He was not going away, and he
would not be ignored.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s one o¡¯clock,¡±
Wally announced. ¡°You had lunch?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Lunch? I¡¯ve been
with you for the past two hours. You seen me eat lunch?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m hungry.
There¡¯s a Taco Bell up there on the right. Let¡¯s use the drive-thru.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re paying,
right?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Right.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I love Taco Bell.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Bowie ordered soft
tacos for himself and a burrito supreme for his passenger. As they waited in
line, Bowie said, ¡°So I keep thinking, <a name=page42></a>¡®What¡¯s this guy
doing at all these funeral homes?¡¯ you know? None of my business, but I¡¯ve been
driving for eighteen years, and I¡¯ve never had a ride who popped in on funeral
homes all over town. Never had a ride who had that many friends, know what I
mean?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re right about
one thing,¡± Wally said, looking up from even more of Lyle¡¯s research. ¡°It¡¯s
none of your business.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Wow. Zinged me on
that one, didn¡¯t you? Pegged you for a nice guy.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m a lawyer.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°From bad to worse.
Just kidding, you know, my uncle¡¯s a lawyer. Jerk.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally handed him a
$20 bill. Bowie took the sack of food and distributed it. Back on the street,
he crammed a taco into his mouth and stopped talking.</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Rochelle was secretly reading a romance novel
when she heard footsteps on the front porch. She deftly stuffed the paperback
into a drawer and moved her fingertips to the keyboard so she seemed to be hard
at work when the door opened. A man and a woman entered timidly, their eyes
darting around, almost in fear. This was not unusual. Rochelle had seen a
thousand come and go, and they almost always entered with grim and suspecting
faces. And why not? They wouldn¡¯t be there if they were not in trouble, and for
most it was their first visit to a law office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good afternoon,¡±

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle managed a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I think so,¡±

scoot the chairs farther away from each other. This could get ugly, Rochelle
thought. She pulled out a questionnaire and found a pen. ¡°Your names, please.

better than Flander,¡± Barbara shot back. ¡°Flander sounds like someplace in
Europe or somebody who sleeps around&#8212;fi-lander or fi-lander-er. Don¡¯t you think
so?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Both were staring
at Rochelle, who calmly asked, ¡°Any minor children under the age of eighteen?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Both shook their
heads. ¡°Two grown,¡± Mrs. Flander said. ¡°Six grandkids.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She didn¡¯t ask
about grandkids,¡± Mr. Flander said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, I damn sure
told her, didn¡¯t I?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle managed to
guide them through birth dates, address, Social Security numbers, and
employment histories without serious conflict. ¡°And you say you¡¯ve been married
for forty-two years?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Both nodded
defiantly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She was tempted to
ask why, and what went wrong, and couldn¡¯t this be salvaged? But she knew
better than to start that conversation. Let the lawyers deal with it. ¡°You
mentioned a property settlement. I assume what you have in mind is a no-fault
divorce, on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s right,¡± Mr.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s all right
here,¡± Mrs. Flander said, clutching the envelope.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°House, cars, bank
accounts, retirement accounts, credit cards, debts, even furniture and
appliances?¡± Rochelle asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Everything,¡± he
said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s all right
here,¡± Mrs. Flander said again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page45></a><span lang=EN>¡°And
you¡¯re both satisfied with the agreement?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh yes,¡± he said. ¡°We¡¯ve
done all the work, all we need is for a lawyer to draw up the papers and go to
court with us. No hassle whatsoever.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s the only
way to do it,¡± Rochelle said, the voice of experience. ¡°I¡¯ll get one of our
lawyers to meet with you and go into more detail. Our firm charges $750 for a
no-fault divorce, and we require half of that to be paid at the initial
conference. The other half is due on the day you go to court.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The Flanders
reacted differently. Her jaw dropped in disbelief, as if Rochelle had demanded
$10,000 in cash. His eyes narrowed and his forehead wrinkled, as if this was
exactly what he expected&#8212;a first-class shaft job by a bunch of slimy lawyers.
Not a word, until Rochelle asked, ¡°Is something wrong?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Mr. Flander
growled, ¡°What is this, the old bait and switch? This firm advertises no-fault
divorces for $399, then you get us in the door and double the price.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle¡¯s
immediate reaction was to ask herself, What has Wally done now? He advertised
so much, in so many ways, and in so many odd places that it was impossible to
keep up with him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Mr. Flander stood
abruptly, yanked something from his pocket, and tossed it on Rochelle¡¯s desk.
¡°Look at this,¡± he said. It was a bingo card from VFW Post 178, McKinley Park.
Across the bottom was a bright yellow ad announcing: ¡°Finley &amp; Figg,
Attorneys, No-Fault Divorces as Easy as Pie, $399. Call 773-718-JUSTICE.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle had been
surprised so many times that she should have been immune. But bingo cards? She
had watched as prospective clients rifled through purses, and bags, and pockets
to pull out church bulletins, football programs, Rotary Club raffles, coupons,
and a hundred other little pieces of propaganda that Attorney Figg littered
around Greater Chicago in his ceaseless quest to drum up business. And now he¡¯d
done it again. She had to admit that she was indeed surprised.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The firm¡¯s fee
schedule was always a moving target, with the costs of representation subject
to change on the fly depending on the client <a name=page46></a>and the
situation. A nicely dressed couple driving a late-model car might get a quote
of $1,000 for a no-fault from one lawyer, and an hour later a working stiff and
his haggard wife could negotiate half that much from the other lawyer. Part of
Rochelle¡¯s daily grind was ironing out fee disputes and discrepancies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Bingo cards? Easy
as pie for $399? Oscar would blow a gasket.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Okay,¡± she said
calmly, as if bingo card advertising were a long tradition at their firm. ¡°I
need to see your property settlement.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Mrs. Flander handed
it over. Rochelle scanned it quickly, then gave it back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Let me see if Mr.
Finley is in,¡± she said. She took the bingo card with her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar¡¯s door was
closed, as always. The firm had a rigid closed-door policy that kept the
lawyers shielded from each other and from the street traffic and riffraff that
ventured in. From Rochelle¡¯s perch near the front, she could see every
door&#8212;Oscar¡¯s, Wally¡¯s, the kitchen, the downstairs restroom, the copy room, and
a small junk room used for storage. She also knew the lawyers had a tendency to
listen quietly through their closed doors when she was grilling a prospective
client. Wally had a side door he often used to escape from a client who
promised trouble, but Oscar did not. She knew he was at his desk, and since
Wally was hitting the funeral homes, she had no choice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She closed his door
behind her and placed the bingo card in front of Mr. Finley. ¡°You¡¯re not going
to believe this,¡± she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What¡¯s he done
now?¡± Oscar asked as he scanned the card. ¡°Three hundred and ninety-nine dollars?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yep.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I thought we

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, we agreed on
$750, then $600, then $1,000, then $500. Next week I¡¯m sure we¡¯ll agree on
something else.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I will not do a

was Taser guns.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar laid the
bingo card on his desk and stared at it. He shook his head, mumbled to himself,
and asked, ¡°What kind of tormented mind could even conceive of the notion of
advertising on bingo cards in a VFW?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Figg,¡± she said
without hesitation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I might have to

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll hold him
down.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Dump this riffraff
on his desk. Make an appointment. They can come back later. It¡¯s an outrage
that people think they can just walk in off the street and see a lawyer, even
Figg, without an appointment. Give me a little dignity, okay?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Okay, you have
dignity. Look, they have some assets and almost no debt. They¡¯re in their

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>By
3:00 p.m., Abner¡¯s was quiet again. Eddie had somehow disappeared with the
lunch crowd, and David Zinc was alone at the bar. Four middle-aged men were
getting drunk in a booth as they made big plans for a bonefishing trip to
Mexico.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Abner was washing
glasses in a small sink near the beer taps. He was talking about Miss Spence.
¡°Her last husband was Angus Spence. Ring a bell?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David shook his
head. At that moment, nothing rang a bell. The lights were on, but no one was
home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Angus was the
billionaire no one knew. Owned a bunch of potash deposits in Canada and
Australia. Died ten years ago, left her with <a name=page48></a>a bundle. She
would be on the Forbes list, but they can¡¯t find all the assets. The old man
was too smart. She lives in a penthouse on the lake, comes in every day at
eleven, has three Pearl Harbors for lunch, leaves at 12:15 when the crowd comes
in, and I guess she goes home and sleeps it off.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I think she¡¯s cute.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She¡¯s
ninety-four.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She didn¡¯t pay her
tab.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She doesn¡¯t get a
tab. She sends me a thousand bucks every month. She wants that stool and three
drinks and her privacy. I¡¯ve never seen her talk to anyone before. You should

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She wants my
body.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, you know
where to find her.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David took a small
sip of a Guinness stout. Rogan Rothberg was a distant memory. He wasn¡¯t so sure
about Helen, and he really didn¡¯t care. He had decided to get wonderfully drunk
and enjoy the moment. Tomorrow would be brutal, and he would deal with it then.
Nothing, absolutely nothing, could interfere with this delightful slide into
oblivion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Abner slid a cup of
coffee in front of him and said, ¡°Just brewed it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David ignored it.
He said, ¡°So you work on retainer, huh? Just like a law firm. What could I get

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°At the rate you¡¯re

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For initial
client conferences, Oscar always put on his dark jacket and straightened his
tie. It was important to set the tone, and a lawyer <a name=page49></a>in a
black suit meant power, knowledge, and authority. Oscar firmly believed the
image also conveyed the message that he did not work cheap, though he usually
did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He pored over the
proposed property settlement, frowning as if it had been drafted by a couple of
idiots. The Flanders were on the other side of his desk. They occasionally
glanced around to take in the Ego Wall, a potpourri of framed photos showing
Mr. Finley grinning and shaking hands with unknown celebrities, and framed
certificates purporting to show that Mr. Finley was highly trained and skilled,
and a few plaques that were clear proof he had been justly recognized over the
years. The other walls were lined with shelves packed with thick, somber law
books and treatises, more proof still that Mr. Finley knew his stuff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What¡¯s the value
of the house?¡± he asked without taking his eyes off the agreement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Around two-fifty,¡±
Mr. Flander replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I think it¡¯s
more,¡± Mrs. Flander added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°This is not a good
time to be selling a house,¡± Oscar said wisely, though every homeowner in
America knew the market was weak. More silence as the wise man studied their
work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He lowered the
papers and peered over his drugstore reading glasses into the expectant eyes of
Mrs. Flander. ¡°You¡¯re getting the washer and dryer, along with the microwave,
treadmill, and flat-screen television?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, yes.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°In fact, you¡¯re
getting probably 80 percent of the household furnishings, right?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I suppose. What¡¯s
wrong with that?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Nothing, except
he¡¯s getting most of the cash.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I think it¡¯s
fair,¡± said Mr. Flander.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m sure you do.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Do you think it¡¯s
fair?¡± she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar shrugged as
if it weren¡¯t his business. ¡°Pretty typical, I¡¯d say. But cash is more
important than a trainload of used furniture. You¡¯ll <a name=page50></a>probably
move into an apartment, something much smaller, and you won¡¯t have enough room
for all your old stuff. He, on the other hand, has money in the bank.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She shot a hard
look at her soon-to-be-ex-husband. Oscar hammered away. ¡°And your car is three

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It was his idea,¡±

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Louder, Barbara
responded, ¡°And don¡¯t you start lying in front of the lawyer, Cal. We agreed we

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh, sure, but how

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, yes, I

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle heard the
voices and smiled to herself. She turned a page of her paperback. AC, asleep
beside her, suddenly rose to his feet and began a low growl. Rochelle looked at
him, then slowly got up and walked to a window. She adjusted the blinds to give
herself a view, then she heard it&#8212;the distant wail of a siren. As it grew
louder, AC¡¯s growl also picked up the volume.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar was also at a
window, casually looking at the intersection in the distance, hoping for a
glimpse of the ambulance. It was a habit too hard to break, not that he really
wanted to stop. He, along with Wally and now Rochelle and perhaps thousands of
lawyers in the city, couldn¡¯t suppress a rush of adrenaline at the sound of an
approaching ambulance. And the sight of one flying down the street always made
him smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page51></a><span lang=EN>The
Flanders, though, were not smiling. They had gone silent, both glaring at him,
each hating the other. When the siren faded away, Oscar returned to his chair
and said, ¡°Look, folks, if you¡¯re going to fight, I can¡¯t represent both of
you.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Both were tempted
to bolt. Once on the street, they could go their separate ways and find more
reputable lawyers, but for a second or two they were not sure what to do. Then
Mr. Flander blinked. He jumped to his feet and headed for the door. ¡°Don¡¯t
worry about it, Finley. I¡¯ll go find me a real lawyer.¡± He opened the door,
slammed it behind him, then stomped past Rochelle and the dog as they were
settling into their places. He yanked open the front door, slammed it too, and
happily left Finley &amp; Figg forever.</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Happy hour ran from five to seven, and Abner
decided his new best friend should leave before it started. He called a cab,
soaked a clean towel with cold water, then walked to the other side of the bar
and gently punched him. ¡°David, wake up, pal, it¡¯s almost five o¡¯clock.¡± David
had been out for an hour. Abner, like all good bartenders, did not want his
after-work crowd to see a drunk facedown on the bar, comatose, snoring. Abner
touched his face with the towel and said, ¡°Come on, big guy. Party¡¯s over.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David suddenly came
around. His eyes and mouth flew open as he gawked at Abner. ¡°What, what, what?¡±
he stammered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s almost five.

David shouted, stunned at the news. There were half a dozen other drinkers in
the bar, all watching with sympathy. Tomorrow it could be them. David got to
his feet and with Abner¡¯s help managed to pull on his overcoat and find his
briefcase. ¡°How long have I been here?¡± he asked, looking around wildly as if
he¡¯d just discovered the place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A long time,¡±
Abner replied. He stuffed a business card into a coat pocket and said, ¡°Call me

David into the seat, said ¡°He¡¯s all yours¡± to the driver, and closed the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page53></a><span lang=EN>David

the driver asked.</span></p>

started to spin. There was a loud honk from behind. The driver eased into
traffic. ¡°Not so fast,¡± David said with his eyes closed. They were going ten
miles an hour. ¡°Go north,¡± David said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I need a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I might be sick,¡±
David said, swallowing hard and afraid to open his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They stopped and

the driver repeated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David opened his
left eye and looked out the window. Next to the cab was a city transit bus
waiting in traffic, packed with weary workers, its exhaust spewing fumes. Along
its side was an ad, three feet by one, proclaiming the services of Finley &amp;
Figg, Attorneys. ¡°Drunk Driving? Call the Experts. 773-718-JUSTICE.¡± Address in
smaller print. David opened his right eye and for an instant saw the smiling
face of Wally Figg. He focused on the word ¡°drunk¡± and wondered if they could
help in some way. Had he seen such ads before? Had he heard of these guys? He
wasn¡¯t sure. Nothing was clear; nothing made sense. The cab was suddenly
spinning again, and faster now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally dropped a

A big mass tort firm in Fort Lauderdale sued Varrick Labs last week over
Krayoxx, a class action. They claim the drug vastly increases the risk of heart
attack and stroke, and they have experts to prove it. Varrick has put more crap
on the market than any of the Big Pharmas, and it¡¯s also paid more in damages.
Billions. Looks like Krayoxx is its latest boondoggle. The mass tort boys are
just now waking up. This is happening now, Oscar, and if we can pick up a dozen

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ve heard this

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When
the cab stopped, David was awake again, though semiconscious. With some effort,
he managed to toss two $20 bills over the front seat and with even more effort

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When the laughing

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Not too far away, a
driver hit the horn, a long frantic sound that could only end badly. Another
driver slammed his brakes violently. Another horn, more brakes, and for a long
second the firm of Finley &amp; Figg held its collective breath. The crash that
followed was thunderous, more impressive than most, and it was obvious that
several cars had just mangled themselves at the intersection of Preston, Beech,
and Thirty-eighth. Oscar grabbed his overcoat. Rochelle grabbed her sweater.
They followed Wally out the front door, leaving the drunk behind to take care
of himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Along Preston,
other offices emptied as lawyers and their clerks and paralegals raced to
inspect the mayhem and offer solace to the injured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The pileup involved
at least four cars, all damaged and scattered. One was lying on its roof, tires
still spinning. There were screams amid the panic and sirens in the distance.
Wally ran to a badly crumpled Ford. The front passenger door had been torn off,
and a teenage girl was trying to get out. She was dazed and covered in blood.
He took her arm and led her away from the wreckage. Rochelle helped as they sat
the girl on a nearby bus bench. Wally returned to the carnage in search of
other clients. Oscar had already found an eyewitness, someone who could help
place blame and thus attract clients. Finley &amp; Figg knew how to work a
wreck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The teenager¡¯s
mother had been in the rear seat, and Wally helped her too. He walked her to the
bus bench and into the waiting arms of Rochelle. Vince Gholston, their rival
from across the street, appeared, and Wally saw him. ¡°Stay away, Gholston,¡± he
barked. ¡°These are our clients now.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No way, Figg.
They¡¯re not signed up.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Stay away, asshole.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A crowd grew
quickly as onlookers rushed to the scene. Traffic was not moving, and many
drivers got out of their cars to take a look. Someone yelled, ¡°I smell gas!¡±
which immediately increased the panic. A Toyota was upside down, and its
occupants were trying desperately to get out. A large man with boots kicked at
a window but could <a name=page58></a>not break it. People were yelling,
screaming. The sirens were getting closer. Wally was circling a Buick whose
driver appeared to be unconscious. Oscar was handing out business cards to
everyone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In the midst of
this mayhem, a young man¡¯s voice boomed through the air. ¡°Stay away from our
clients!¡± he yelled, and everyone followed the voice. It was an amazing sight.
David Zinc was near the bus bench, holding a large, jagged piece of metal from
the wreckage, waving it near the face of a frightened Vince Gholston, who was
backing away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°These are our
clients!¡± David said angrily. He looked crazed, and there was no doubt he would
use the weapon if necessary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar moved next to
Wally and said, ¡°That kid may have some potential after all.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>When Helen Zinc pulled in to the driveway at 418
Preston, the first thing she noticed was not the well-worn exterior of Finley
&amp; Figg, Attorneys-at-Law; rather, it was the flashing neon sign next door
advertising massages. She turned off the lights and the engine and sat for a
moment to gather her thoughts. Her husband was alive and safe; he¡¯d just had ¡°a
few drinks,¡± according to one Wally Figg, a somewhat pleasant man who¡¯d phoned
an hour earlier. Mr. Figg was ¡°sitting with her husband,¡± whatever that meant.
The digital clock on the dash gave the time as 8:20, so for almost twelve hours
now she had been worrying frantically over his whereabouts and safety. Now that
she knew he was alive, she was thinking of ways to kill him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She glanced around,
taking in the neighborhood, disapproving of everything about it, then got out
of her BMW and slowly headed for the door. She had asked Mr. Figg how, exactly,
her husband made his way from the tall buildings of downtown Chicago to the
blue-collar neighborhood around Preston Avenue. Mr. Figg had said he didn¡¯t
have all the details, and it would be best if they talked about it later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She opened the
front door. A cheap bell rattled. A dog growled at her but made no effort to
attack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle Gibson and
Oscar Finley were gone. Wally was sitting at the table, clipping obituaries
from old newspapers, and dining on a bag of chips and a diet soda. He stood
quickly, swiped his hands on his pants, and offered a big smile. ¡°You must be
Helen,¡± he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page60></a><span lang=EN>¡°I

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m Wally Figg,¡±
he said, already sizing her up. A very nice package. Short auburn hair, hazel
eyes behind chic designer frames, five feet eight, slender, well dressed. Wally
approved. He then turned and waved an arm in the direction of the cluttered
table. Beyond it, against the wall, was an old leather sofa, and on the sofa was
David Zinc, dead to the world, comatose again. His right pants leg was torn&#8212;a
small wound from the car smashup and its aftermath&#8212;but other than that he
looked quite undisturbed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Helen took a few
steps over and gave him a look. ¡°Are you sure he¡¯s alive?¡± she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh yes, very much
so. He got into a scuffle at the car wreck and tore his pants.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A scuffle?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yep, guy named
Gholston, a slimeball across the street, was trying to steal one of our clients
after the big wreck, and David here chased him off with a piece of metal.
Somehow he tore his pants.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Helen, who had
endured enough for one day, shook her head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Would you like
something to drink? Coffee, water, Scotch?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t drink

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally looked at

thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Neither do I,¡± he
said proudly. ¡°There¡¯s fresh coffee. I made a pot for David, and he drank two
cups before taking his little nap.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, thank you,¡±
she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They sipped coffee
at the table and spoke softly. ¡°The best I can tell,¡± Wally said, ¡°is that he
snapped on the elevator this morning as he was going to work. Cracked up, left
the building, and wound up in a bar where he pretty much spent the whole day
drinking.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s what I
gather,¡± she said. ¡°But how did he get here?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Haven¡¯t got that
far yet, but I gotta tell you, Helen, he says he¡¯s not going back, says he

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She couldn¡¯t help
herself as she glanced around the large, open, <a name=page61></a>cluttered
room. It would be difficult to imagine a place that appeared to be less
prosperous. ¡°Your dog?¡± she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s AC, the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How many lawyers

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Just two. It¡¯s a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And what kind of

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Like all those

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We don¡¯t do TV,¡±
Wally said smugly. If she only knew. He worked on his scripts all the time. He
fought with Oscar about spending the money. He watched with envy as other
injury lawyers flooded the airwaves with ads that, in his opinion, were almost
always poorly done. And, most painfully, he imagined all the lost fees from all
the lost cases scooped up by less talented lawyers willing to roll the dice on
a TV budget.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David made a
gurgling sound and followed it up with a quick nasal snort, and though he was
at least making noises, there was no indication he was anywhere near
consciousness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Do you think he¡¯ll

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Hard to say,¡±
Wally observed. His romance with alcohol was long and ugly, and he had spent
many fogged-in mornings struggling to remember what had happened. Wally took a
sip and said, ¡°Look, really none of my business and all, but does he do this
often? He says he wants to work here, and, well, we need to know if he might
have a problem with the bottle.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He doesn¡¯t drink
much at all. Never has. He might occasionally at a party, but he works too hard

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Just curious. I¡¯ve

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, I suppose. Or

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It would, but I¡¯d

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Once
awake, David chatted pleasantly with his wife as if nothing had happened. He
walked unaided from the office, down the front steps, and to the car. He yelled
a long good-bye and a hearty thanks to Wally and even offered to drive. Helen
declined. They left Preston and headed north.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For five minutes
nothing was said. Then Helen casually began, ¡°Look, I think I have most of the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Abner¡¯s. A few

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Between 7:30 and
8:00. I fled the office, ran a few blocks, found Abner¡¯s.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And started

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page63></a><span lang=EN>¡°Oh

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, let¡¯s see.¡±
He paused as he tried to remember. ¡°For breakfast, I had four of Abner¡¯s

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And you liked

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, a widow. She¡¯s

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh no, just Miss

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You blacked out?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So how did you get
from the bar to that law office back there?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A cab. Paid the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Now we¡¯re making

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David began shaking
his head as he pondered this. Finally, he said, ¡°I have no idea.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There was so much
to talk about. The drinking&#8212;could there be a problem, in spite of what she¡¯d
told Wally? Rogan Rothberg&#8212;was he going back? Should she bring up Roy Barton¡¯s
ultimatum? Finley &amp; Figg&#8212;was he serious? Helen had a lot on her mind,
plenty to say, a long list of complaints, but at the same time she couldn¡¯t
help but be <a name=page64></a>slightly amused. She had never seen her husband
so plastered, and the fact that he¡¯d jumped from a tall building downtown and
landed in the outback would soon become a family tale of legendary proportions.
He was safe, and that was really all that mattered. And he probably wasn¡¯t
crazy. The crack-up could be dealt with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I have a
question,¡± he said, his eyelids getting heavier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I have lots of
questions,¡± she replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m sure you do,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Fair enough.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Are your parents,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°They love you,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Why is everyone so

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So I had a bad

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A bad day?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Actually, it was a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Why don¡¯t we argue
tomorrow, David? Isn¡¯t that what you asked?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, but I¡¯m not
getting out of the car until they leave. Please.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They were on the
Stevenson Expressway, and traffic was heavier. Nothing was said as they inched
along. David struggled to stay awake. Helen finally picked up the cell phone

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>About once a month Rochelle Gibson arrived for
work expecting her usual quiet time, only to find the office already opened,
the coffee brewed, the dog fed, and Mr. Figg bustling around with excitement
over a new scheme to stalk injured people. This irritated her immensely. It not
only ruined the few tranquil moments in her otherwise noisy day but also meant
more work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She was barely
inside the door when Wally nailed her with a hearty ¡°Well, good morning, Ms.
Gibson,¡± as if he were surprised to see her arrive at work at 7:30 on a
Thursday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good morning, Mr.
Figg,¡± she replied with far less enthusiasm. She almost added ¡°And what brings
you here so early?¡± but held her tongue. She would hear about his scheme soon
enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With coffee,
yogurt, and the newspaper, she settled at her desk and tried to ignore him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I met David¡¯s wife
last night,¡± Wally said from the table across the room. ¡°Very cute and nice.
Said he doesn¡¯t drink much, maybe blows it out from time to time. I think the
pressure gets to him occasionally. I know that¡¯s my story. Always the
pressure.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When Wally drank,
he needed no excuse. He boozed it up after a hard day, and he had wine with
lunch on an easy day. He drank when he was stressed, and he drank on the golf
course. Rochelle had seen and heard it all before. She also kept up with the
score&#8212;sixty-one days without a drink. That was the story of Wally¡¯s life&#8212;a
count of some <a name=page66></a>sort always in progress. Days on the wagon.
Days until his driving suspension was over. Days until his current divorce was
final. And sadly, days until he was released from rehab.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What time did she
get him?¡± she asked without looking up from the newspaper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°After eight. He
walked out of here, even asked if he could drive. She said no.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Was she upset?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She was pretty
cool. Relieved more than anything else. The big question is whether he¡¯ll
remember anything. And if he does, then the question is whether he¡¯ll find us
again. Will he really walk away from the big firm and the big bucks? I got my
doubts.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle had her
doubts too, but she was trying to minimize the conversation. Finley &amp; Figg
was not the place for a big-firm type with a Harvard degree, and, frankly, she
didn¡¯t want another lawyer complicating her life. She had her hands full with
these two.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I could use him,
though,¡± Wally went on, and Rochelle knew the latest scheme was now on the way.
¡°You ever hear of a cholesterol drug called Krayoxx?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯ve already
asked me this.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It causes heart
attacks and strokes, and the truth is just now coming out. The first wave of
litigation is unfolding, could be tens of thousands of cases before it¡¯s over.

Lauderdale yesterday. They¡¯ve already filed a class action and are looking for
more cases.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle turned a
page as if she were hearing nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Anyway, I¡¯m
spending the next few days looking for Krayoxx cases, and I could sure use some
help. Are you listening, Ms. Gibson?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How many names are
in our client database, both active and retired?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She took a bite of
yogurt and seemed exasperated. ¡°We have about two hundred active files,¡± she
said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page67></a><span lang=EN>At
Finley &amp; Figg, though, a file deemed active was not necessarily one that
received attention. More often than not, it was simply a neglected file that no
one had bothered to retire. Wally usually had about thirty files he would touch
in a week¡¯s time&#8212;divorces, wills, estates, injuries, drunk drivers, small
contract disputes&#8212;and another fifty or so he diligently avoided. Oscar, who was
more willing to take on a new client but was also slightly more organized than
his junior partner, had about one hundred open files. Throw in a few that were
lost, hidden, or unaccounted for, and the number was always around two hundred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And retired?¡± he
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A sip of coffee,
another grunt. ¡°Last time I checked, the computer showed three thousand files
retired since 1991. I don¡¯t know what¡¯s upstairs.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Upstairs was the
final resting place for everything&#8212;old law books, outdated computers and word
processors, unused office supplies, and dozens of boxes of files Oscar had
retired before he added Wally as a partner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Three thousand,¡±
Wally said with a satisfied grin, as if such a large number were clear evidence
of a long and successful career. ¡°Here¡¯s the plan, Ms. Gibson. I have drafted a
letter that I want you to print on our stationery. It goes to every client,
current and past, active and retired. Every name in our client database.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle thought of
all the unhappy clients who had left Finley &amp; Figg. The unpaid fees, the
nasty letters, the threats of malpractice lawsuits. She even kept a file
labeled ¡°Threats.¡± Over the years, half a dozen or so disgruntled ex-clients
had been angry enough to put their feelings on paper. A couple promised
ambushes and beatings. One mentioned a sniper¡¯s rifle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Why not leave these
poor people alone? They had suffered enough having passed through the office
the first time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle did the

disgusted and continued to his office, where he slammed the door. Before he
could remove his coat and park his umbrella, Wally was at his desk, nibbling on
a muffin and waving one of the letters. ¡°You gotta read this, Oscar,¡± he said.
¡°This is brilliant.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar read it, the
wrinkles in his forehead getting deeper and deeper with each paragraph. When he
finished, he said, ¡°Come on, Wally, not again. How many of these are you
sending out?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Three thousand.
Our entire client list.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What? Think of the
postage. Think of the wasted time. Here we go again. You¡¯ll spend the next
month running around chirping about Krayoxx this and Krayoxx that, and you¡¯ll
waste a hundred hours looking for worthless cases, and on and on. We¡¯ve been
here before, Wally, come on. Do something productive.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Like what?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Like go hang out
in an emergency room somewhere, wait for a real case to come in. I don¡¯t have
to tell you how to find good cases.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m tired of that
crap, Oscar. I wanna make some money. Let¡¯s hit it big for a change.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page70></a><span lang=EN>¡°My
wife¡¯s been taking the drug for two years. Loves it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Did you tell her
to stop, that it¡¯s killing people?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Of course not.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As their voices
grew louder, Rochelle eased over and quietly closed the door to Oscar¡¯s office.
She was returning to her desk when the front door suddenly opened. It was David
Zinc, bright and sober with a big smile, sharp suit, cashmere overcoat, and two
thick briefcases loaded to the max.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, well, if it
ain¡¯t Mr. Harvard,¡± Rochelle said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m back.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m surprised you
could find us.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It wasn¡¯t easy.
Where¡¯s my office?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, uh, let¡¯s
see. I¡¯m not sure we have one. Perhaps we should ask the two bosses about
this.¡± She nodded to Oscar¡¯s door, beyond which voices could be heard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So they¡¯re here?¡±
David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, they usually
start the day with a round of bickering.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I see.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Look, Harvard, are
you sure you know what you¡¯re doing? This is another world. You¡¯re taking a
plunge here, leaving the fancy life of corporate law for the bush leagues. You
might get hurt out here, and you sure won¡¯t make any money.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ve done the
big-firm thing, Ms. Gibson, and I¡¯ll jump off a bridge before I go back. Just
give me a little room somewhere to park myself, and I¡¯ll figure it out.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The door opened,
and Wally and Oscar emerged. They froze when they saw David standing in front
of Rochelle¡¯s desk. Wally smiled and said, ¡°Well, good morning, David. You look
surprisingly healthy.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thank you, and I¡¯d
like to apologize for my appearance yesterday.¡± He nodded at all three as he
spoke. ¡°You caught me at the tail end of a rather unusual episode, but it was
nonetheless a very important day in my life. I quit the big firm, and here I
am, ready to go to work.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What type of work
do you have in mind?¡± Oscar asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page71></a><span lang=EN>David
gave a slight shrug as if he didn¡¯t have a clue. ¡°For the past five years, I¡¯ve
labored in the dungeon of bond underwriting, with emphasis on second- and
third-tier aftermarket spreads, primarily for foreign multinational
corporations that prefer to avoid paying taxes anywhere in the world. If you
have no idea what that is, then don¡¯t worry. No one else does either. What it
means is that a small team of us idiots labored fifteen hours a day in a room
with no windows creating paperwork, and more paperwork. I¡¯ve never seen the
inside of a courtroom, or a courthouse for that matter, never met a judge when
he was wearing a robe, never offered a hand to help a person who needed a real
lawyer. To answer your question, Mr. Finley, I¡¯m here to do anything. Think of
me as a rookie fresh out of law school who doesn¡¯t know his ass from a hole in
the ground. But I¡¯m a quick study.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Compensation should
have been the next issue, but the partners were reluctant to talk money in
front of Rochelle. She, of course, would take the position that anyone they
hired, lawyer or otherwise, should be paid less than she was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°There is some
space upstairs,¡± Wally said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll take it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s a junk room,¡±
Oscar said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll take it,¡±
David said, lifting his two briefcases, ready to move in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I haven¡¯t been up
there in years,¡± Rochelle said, rolling her eyes, obviously unhappy with the
firm¡¯s sudden expansion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A narrow door next
to the kitchen led to a stairway. David followed Wally, with Oscar bringing up
the rear. Wally was excited about having someone to help hustle Krayoxx cases.
Oscar was thinking only of how much this might cost in salary, withholding
taxes, unemployment deductions, and, heaven forbid, health insurance. Finley
&amp; Figg offered little in the way of benefits&#8212;no 401(k), no IRA, no
retirement of any kind, and certainly no health or dental plan. Rochelle had
been griping for years because she was forced to buy her own private policy, as
did the two partners. What if young David here expected health insurance?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As Oscar climbed
the stairs, he felt the burden of a heavier overhead. <a name=page72></a>More
spent at the office meant less to take home. His retirement seemed even more
elusive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The junk room was
exactly that, a dark, dusty landfill with spiderwebs and pieces of old
furniture and boxes of files. ¡°I like it,¡± David said when Wally switched on
the light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He must be crazy,
Oscar thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But there was a
small desk and a couple of chairs. David saw only the potential. And there were
two windows. Sunlight would be a nice addition to his life. When it was dark
outside, he would be at home with Helen, procreating.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar swiped away a
large spiderweb and said, ¡°Look, David, we can offer a small salary, but you¡¯re
gonna have to generate your own fees. And this won¡¯t be easy, at least
initially.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Initially? Oscar
had been struggling to generate meager fees for over thirty years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What¡¯s the deal?¡±
David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar looked at
Wally, and Wally looked at the wall. The two had not hired an associate in
fifteen years, nor had they even considered doing so. David¡¯s presence had
caught them by surprise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As the senior
partner, Oscar felt compelled to take the initiative. ¡°We can pay a thousand
bucks a month, and you keep half of what you bring in. After six months, we¡¯ll
reevaluate.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally jumped in
quickly with ¡°It will be rough at first, lots of competition out there on the
streets.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We can toss some
files your way,¡± Oscar added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯ll give you a
piece of the Krayoxx litigation,¡± Wally said, as if they were already banking
huge fees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The what?¡± David
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Never mind,¡± Oscar
said with a frown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Look, guys,¡± David
said with a smile. He was far more at ease than they were. ¡°I¡¯ve made a very
nice salary for the past five years. I¡¯ve spent a lot, but there¡¯s a chunk in the
bank. Don¡¯t worry about me. I¡¯ll take the deal.¡± And with that he thrust out a
hand, shaking Oscar¡¯s first, then Wally¡¯s.</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>David cleaned for the next hour. He wiped dust
from the desk and chairs. He found an old Hoover in the kitchen and vacuumed
the plank floors. He filled three large bags with trash and put them on the
small porch out back. He stopped occasionally to admire the windows and
sunlight, something he¡¯d never done at Rogan Rothberg. Sure, on a clear day the
view across Lake Michigan was captivating, but he had learned during his first
year with the firm that time spent gazing out from the Trust Tower was time
that could not be billed. Rookie associates were placed in bunker-like
cubicles, where they toiled around the clock and, with time, forgot about
sunshine and daydreaming. Now David couldn¡¯t stay away from the windows. The
view, admittedly, was not as captivating. Looking down, he could see the
massage parlor, and beyond it the intersection of Preston, Beech, and
Thirty-eighth, the very spot where he¡¯d taken a piece of metal to the slimeball
Gholston and chased him away. Beyond the intersection was a block of more
converted bungalows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Not much of a view,
but David liked it anyway. It represented an exciting change in his life, a new
challenge. It meant freedom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally dropped in
every ten minutes to check on things, and it became obvious he had something on
his mind. Finally, after an hour, he said, ¡°Say, David, I¡¯m due in court at
eleven. Divorce court. I doubt you¡¯ve ever been there, so I was thinking you
could tag along and I¡¯ll introduce you to the judge.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page74></a><span lang=EN>The
cleaning had become monotonous. David said, ¡°Let¡¯s go.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As they were
leaving through the back door, Wally said, ¡°Is that your Audi SUV?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It is.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Do you mind driving?
I¡¯ll do the talking.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As they were
pulling onto Preston, Wally said, ¡°Look, David, the truth is that I got a DUI a
year ago and my license is suspended. There, I said it. I believe in being
honest.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Okay. You¡¯ve
certainly seen me drunk enough.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I have indeed. But
your cute wife told me you¡¯re not much of a drinker. I, on the other hand, have
quite a history. I¡¯m sober for sixty-one days now. Every day is a challenge. I
go to AA, and I¡¯ve rehabbed several times. What else do you want to know?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I didn¡¯t bring
this up.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oscar, he has a
few strong ones every night. Believe me, with his wife, he needs them, but he
keeps it under control. Some people are like that, you know. They can stop with
two or three. They can skip a few days, even weeks, no problem. Others can¡¯t
stop until they black out, kinda like you yesterday.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thanks, Wally.
Where are we headed, by the way?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The Daley Center
downtown, 50 West Washington. Me, I do fine for a while. I¡¯ve quit four or five
times, you know?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How would I know
that?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Anyway, enough of
the booze.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What¡¯s wrong with
Oscar¡¯s wife?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally whistled and
looked out the side window for a moment. ¡°Tough woman, man. One of these people
who grew up in a nicer part of town, father wore a suit and tie to work, as
opposed to a uniform, so she was raised to believe she¡¯s better than most. A
real snot. She made a major mistake when she married Oscar because she figured
he was a lawyer, right? Lawyers make lots of money, right? Not exactly. Oscar
has never made enough to satisfy her, and she hammers him relentlessly because
she wants more money. I loathe the woman. You won¡¯t <a name=page75></a>meet
her, because she refuses to set foot in the office, which suits me just fine.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Why not get a
divorce?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s what I¡¯ve
been saying for years. Me, I got no problem with divorce. Been down that road
four times.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Four times?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yep, and every
trip was worth the hassle. You know what they say&#8212;the reason divorce is so
expensive is because it¡¯s worth it.¡± Wally laughed at this stale punch line.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Are you married
now?¡± David asked, somewhat cautiously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Nope, back on the
prowl,¡± Wally said smugly, as if no woman were safe. David couldn¡¯t imagine a
less attractive person hitting on females in bars and at parties. So, in less
than fifteen minutes, he had learned Wally was a recovering alcoholic with four
ex-wives, several trips through rehab, and at least one DUI. David decided to
stop with the questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Over breakfast with
Helen, he had dug a bit online and learned that (1) ten years earlier, Finley
&amp; Figg had settled a sexual harassment suit brought by a former secretary;
(2) on one occasion, Oscar had been reprimanded by the state bar association
for overcharging a client in a divorce case; (3) on two prior occasions, Wally
had been reprimanded by the state bar association for ¡°blatant solicitation¡± of
clients who¡¯d been injured in auto accidents, including an apparently messy
affair involving Wally wearing doctor¡¯s scrubs and barging into the hospital
room of a badly wounded teenager who died an hour later; (4) at least four
former clients had sued the firm alleging malpractice, though it was unclear if
any recovered damages; and (5) the firm had been mentioned in a scathing
article written by a professor of legal ethics who was sick of lawyers¡¯
advertising. And all of this was just over breakfast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Helen had been
alarmed, but David took a hard, cynical line and argued that such dubious
behavior couldn¡¯t touch the cutthroat brand of law practiced by the fine folks
at Rogan Rothberg. He had only to mention the Strick River case to win the
argument. The Strick River in Wisconsin had been thoroughly polluted by an
infamous chemical <a name=page76></a>company represented by Rogan Rothberg, and
after decades of brutal litigation and skillful legal wrangling the dumping
continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was digging
through his briefcase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The skyline came
into view, and David looked at the tall, majestic buildings crowded together in
downtown Chicago. The Trust Tower was in the center. ¡°I would be there right
now,¡± he said softly, almost to himself. Wally looked up, saw the skyline, and
realized what David was thinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Which one?¡± Wally
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The Trust Tower.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I was in the Sears

Wheeler. And I thought that¡¯s what I wanted.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What happened?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Couldn¡¯t pass the
bar exam.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David added that to
the growing list of defects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re not going
to miss it, are you?¡± Wally asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, I¡¯m breaking
into a sweat right now, just looking at the building. I don¡¯t want to get any
closer.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Take a left on
Washington. We¡¯re almost there.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Inside
the Richard J. Daley Center, they passed through security scanners and took the
elevator to the sixteenth floor. The place was bustling with lawyers and
litigants, clerks and cops, either hustling about or huddled in little pockets
of serious conversations. Justice was looming, and everyone seemed to be
dreading it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David had no idea
where he was going or what he was doing, so he stuck close to Wally, who seemed
quite at home. David was carrying his briefcase, which held only a single legal
pad. They passed courtroom after courtroom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Have you really
never seen the inside of a courtroom?¡± Wally asked as they walked quickly,
their shoes clicking along on the worn marble tile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page77></a><span lang=EN>¡°Not

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Unbelievable. What

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You don¡¯t want to

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m sure you¡¯re
right about that. This is us,¡± Wally said, pointing to the heavy double doors
of a courtroom. A sign said: ¡°Circuit Court of Cook County&#8212;Divorce Division,
Hon. Charles Bradbury.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who¡¯s Bradbury?¡±
David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re about to
meet him.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally opened the
door, and they stepped inside. There were a few spectators scattered through
the rows of benches. The lawyers were seated up front, bored and waiting. The
witness chair was empty; no trial was in progress. Judge Bradbury was reviewing
a document and taking his time. David and Wally sat in the second row. Wally
scanned the courtroom, saw his client, smiled, and nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He whispered to
David, ¡°This is known as an open day, as opposed to a trial day. Generally
speaking, you can get motions granted, routine matters approved, crap like
that. That lady over there in the short yellow dress is our beloved client
DeeAnna Nuxhall, and she thinks she¡¯s about to get another divorce.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Another?¡± David
asked as he glanced over. DeeAnna winked at him. Bleached blonde, huge chest,
legs everywhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ve done one
already. This would be my second. I think she has a prior.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Bradbury

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally and David
walked through the bar, past the tables, and approached the bench, a low one
that allowed the lawyers to almost see eye to eye with His Honor. Bradbury
shoved the microphone away so they could chat without being heard. ¡°What¡¯s up?¡±
he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We have a new
associate, Your Honor,¡± Wally said proudly. ¡°Meet <a name=page78></a>David
Zinc.¡± David reached over and shook hands with the judge, who received him
warmly. ¡°Welcome to my courtroom,¡± he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°David¡¯s been with
a big firm downtown. Now he wants to see the real side of justice,¡± Wally said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You won¡¯t learn
much from Figg,¡± Bradbury said with a chuckle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He went to Harvard
Law School,¡± Wally said, even prouder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Then what are you
doing here?¡± the judge asked, and appeared to be dead serious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Got sick of the
big firm,¡± David said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was handing
over some paperwork. ¡°We have a slight problem here, Judge. My client is the
lovely DeeAnna Nuxhall, fourth row left, in the yellow dress.¡± Bradbury peered
slightly over his reading glasses and said, ¡°She looks familiar.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yep, she was here
about a year ago, second or third divorce.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Same dress, I

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, I think so

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You getting any?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not yet.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David felt faint.
The judge and the lawyer were discussing sex with the client in open court,
though no one could hear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What¡¯s the
problem?¡± Bradbury asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I haven¡¯t been

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What parts have
you squeezed?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Ha-ha. She refuses

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I need a closer

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally turned and motioned
for Ms. Nuxhall to join them at the bench. She stood and wiggled herself from
between the benches, then proceeded to the front. The lawyers went mute. The
two bailiffs woke up. The other spectators gawked. The dress was even shorter
when she walked, and she wore platform spiked heels that would make a hooker
blush. David eased as far away as possible when she joined the boys at the
bench.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Bradbury
pretended not to notice her. He was far too occupied <a name=page79></a>with
the contents of the court file. ¡°Basic no-fault divorce, right, Mr. Figg?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s correct,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, except for

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, Your Honor,¡±
she said in a squeaky voice. ¡°But I¡¯ll have to wait until next week. You see,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>His eyes dancing
from her chest to her face, His Honor said, ¡°It¡¯s my experience, Ms. Nuxhall,
in divorce cases the fees are never paid after the fact. I expect my lawyers to

fee, Mr. Figg?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Six hundred. She
paid half up front.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Six hundred?¡±
Bradbury said, feigning disbelief. ¡°That¡¯s a very reasonable fee, Ms. Nuxhall.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The lawyers and
spectators couldn¡¯t hear the details, but they nonetheless kept their eyes on
DeeAnna, especially her legs and shoes. David backed away even more, shocked at
this shakedown in open court.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Bradbury moved in
for the kill. He raised his voice slightly and said, ¡°I¡¯m not granting this

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wiping her cheeks,
she said, ¡°Please.¡±</span></p>

run a tight ship. I insist that all obligations be met&#8212;alimony, child support,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She turned around
and walked away, His Honor leering at every <a name=page80></a>step. Wally
watched too, shaking his head, marveling, as if ready to pounce. When the door
closed, the courtroom breathed again. Judge Bradbury took a sip of water and
said, ¡°Anything else?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°One more, Judge.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What? You mean

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So what happens

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I rest my case.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh, it sucks all

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, you will. It¡¯s

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I need to run a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page81></a><span lang=EN>A

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh, sure. There

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll wait in the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Miss Spence was on
her throne, eyes glazed, cheeks red, in another world. Abner was hustling
around the bar, mixing drinks, pouring beer, sliding along platters of burgers.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Abner smiled and
said, ¡°So you¡¯re alive after all.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh, sure. Just
left court. You got my tab somewhere close?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Abner fished
through a drawer and pulled out a ticket. ¡°Let¡¯s call it a hundred and thirty

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Is that all?¡±
David handed over two $100 bills and said, ¡°Keep it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Your chick is over
there,¡± Abner said, nodding at Miss Spence, whose eyes were temporarily closed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She¡¯s not as cute

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Highly unlikely,

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>For an unlicensed driver, Wally proved to be a
skillful navigator. Somewhere near Midway Airport, he directed David through a
series of quick turns onto short streets, delivered them from two impossible
dead ends, insisted he drive two blocks the wrong way, and did it all with a
nonstop monologue that included ¡°I know this place like the back of my hand¡±
several times. They parked at the curb in front of a sagging duplex with
aluminum foil covering the windows, a barbecue grill on the front porch, and a
huge orange cat guarding the front door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And who lives
here?¡± David asked, taking in the run-down neighborhood. Two sketchy teenagers
across the street seemed fascinated by his shiny Audi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Here liveth a
lovely woman by the name of Iris Klopeck, widow of Percy Klopeck, who died
about eighteen months ago at the age of forty-eight, died in his sleep. Very
sad. They came to see me about a divorce one time but then changed their minds.
As I recall, he was rather obese, but not nearly as large as she.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The two lawyers
were sitting in the car talking, as if they did not want to get out. Only a
couple of FBI agents in black suits and a black sedan could have been more conspicuous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So, why are we
here?¡± David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Krayoxx, my
friend, Krayoxx. I want to talk to Iris and see if by chance Percy had been on
the drug when he died. If so, then voil&agrave;! We <a name=page83></a>have another
Krayoxx case, worth somewhere between two and four mill. Any more questions?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oh, dozens of
questions. David¡¯s mind was spinning as he realized they were about to
cold-call Ms. Klopeck to inquire about her dead husband. ¡°Is she expecting us?¡±
he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I haven¡¯t called,
have you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, actually.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally yanked open
the door and got out. David reluctantly did the same and managed to frown at
the teenagers admiring his car. The orange cat refused to move from the
doormat. The doorbell could not be heard from outside, so Wally commenced
knocking. Louder and louder, while David continued to glance nervously at the
street. Finally, a chain was heard, then a crack in the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who is it?¡± a
woman asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Attorney Wally
Figg, looking for Ms. Iris Klopeck.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The door opened,
and through the glass storm door Iris presented herself. As large as
advertised, she wore what appeared to be a beige bedsheet with openings for her
head and arms. ¡°Who are you?¡± she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Wally Figg, Iris.
I met you and Percy when you were thinking about a divorce. Probably three
years ago. You guys came to my office over on Preston.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Percy¡¯s dead,¡± she
said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, I know. I¡¯m
sorry. That¡¯s why I¡¯m here. I want to talk about his death. I¡¯m curious about
what medications he was taking when he died.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Why does it
matter?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Because there¡¯s a
lot of litigation over cholesterol drugs and painkillers and antidepressants.
Some of these drugs killed thousands of people. There could be a lot of money
on the table.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A pause as she
looked at them. ¡°The house is a wreck,¡± she said. What a surprise, thought
David. They followed her inside to a narrow, dirty kitchen and sat at the
table. She fixed instant coffee in three mix-matched <a name=page84></a>Bears
mugs, then sat across from them. David¡¯s chair was a flimsy wooden model that
felt as though it might collapse any second. Hers appeared to be of the same
variety. The trip to the door, then to the kitchen, along with the preparation
of the coffee, had winded her. There was sweat on her spongy forehead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally finally got
around to introducing David to Ms. Klopeck. ¡°David went to Harvard Law, and
he¡¯s just joined our firm,¡± Wally said. She did not offer a hand to shake, nor
did Mr. Harvard. She could not have cared less where David, Wally, or anyone
else went to college or law school. Her breathing was as noisy as an old
furnace. The room smelled of dried cat urine and yesterday¡¯s nicotine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally again
expressed his phony condolences for dear Percy¡¯s demise, then quickly got to
the point. ¡°The main drug I¡¯m after is called Krayoxx, a cholesterol drug. Was
Percy taking it when he died?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With no hesitation,
she said, ¡°Yes. He¡¯d taken it for years. I used to take it, but I quit.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was at once
thrilled by Percy¡¯s usage and disappointed that Iris had given it up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Something wrong
with Krayoxx?¡± she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh yes, very
wrong,¡± Wally said, rubbing his hands together. He launched into what was
becoming a fluid and compelling case against Krayoxx and Varrick Labs. He
cherry-picked facts and figures from the preliminary research that was being
touted by the mass tort lawyers. He quoted heavily from the one-sided lawsuit
filed in Fort Lauderdale. He made a convincing case that time was of the
essence and Iris needed to sign on with Finley &amp; Figg immediately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How much will it
cost me?¡± she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not a penny,¡±
Wally fired back. ¡°We front the expenses of litigation and take 40 percent of
the recovery.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The coffee tasted
like saltwater. After one sip, David wanted to spit. Iris, though, seemed to
savor it. She took a long drink, swirled it around her mammoth mouth, then
swallowed. ¡°Forty percent sounds like a lot,¡± she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°This is very
complicated litigation, Iris, against a corporation with <a name=page85></a>a
zillion dollars and a thousand lawyers. Look at it like this: Right now you
have 60 percent of nothing. In a year or two, if you hire our firm, you could
have 60 percent of something big.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How big?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Tough question,
Iris, but then I remember that you always ask the tough questions. That¡¯s what
I always liked about you. Tough question, and to be honest, I can¡¯t answer it,
because no one can predict what a jury might do. The jury might see the truth
about Krayoxx and get ticked off at Varrick and give you five million bucks.
Or, the jury might believe the lies put forth by Varrick and its shifty lawyers
and give you nothing. Me, I tend to think the case will go for around a million
bucks, Iris, but you gotta understand that I¡¯m not making any promises.¡± He
looked at David and said, ¡°Right, David, we can¡¯t make promises in cases like
this? Nothing is guaranteed.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s right,¡±
David said convincingly, the new mass tort specialist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She sloshed some
more saltwater around her mouth and glared at Wally. ¡°I could sure use some
help,¡± she said. ¡°It¡¯s just me and Clint, and he¡¯s only working part-time these
days.¡± Wally and David were taking notes and nodding along as if they knew
exactly who Clint was. She did not bother to elaborate. ¡°I¡¯m living off $1,200
a month Social Security, so anything you can get would be great.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯ll get you
something, Iris. I feel sure of it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°When might this
happen?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Another tough
question, Iris. One theory is that Varrick will get hit so hard with Krayoxx
cases that the company will surrender and negotiate a huge settlement. Most of
the lawyers, including me, expect this to happen within the next twenty-four
months. The other theory is that Varrick will take a few of these cases to

about their drug. If this happens, it might take longer to force a settlement.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Even David, with a
fine law degree and five years of experience, was beginning to believe Wally
knew what he was talking about. The junior partner went on, ¡°If a settlement
occurs, and we certainly believe <a name=page86></a>it will happen, the death
cases will be negotiated first. Then Varrick will be desperate to settle all of
the non-death cases, folks like you.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m a non-death
case?¡± she asked, confused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°For now. The
scientific evidence is not clear, but there appears to be a decent chance that
Krayoxx is responsible for heart damage in many people who are otherwise
healthy.¡± How anyone could look at Iris Klopeck and deem her healthy was
mind-blowing, at least to David.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Mercy,¡± she said
as her eyes watered. ¡°That¡¯s all I need&#8212;more heart problems.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Don¡¯t worry about
it now,¡± Wally said, without the slightest trace of reassurance. ¡°We¡¯ll get to
your case later. The important thing is to get Percy signed up. You¡¯re his
widow and his principal heir; therefore, you need to hire me and act as his
representative.¡± He produced a folded sheet of paper from his rumpled jacket
and spread it before Iris. ¡°This is a contract for legal services. You¡¯ve
signed one before, for the divorce, when you and Percy came to my office.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t remember
signing one,¡± she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We have it on
file. You need to sign a new one before I can handle your claim against
Varrick.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And you¡¯re sure
this is all legal and everything?¡± she asked, hesitant, uncertain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It struck David as
odd that the potential client would ask the lawyer if the document was ¡°legal.¡±
Wally, though, did not inspire a sense of strict ethical standards. Her
question did not faze him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°All of our Krayoxx
clients are signing these,¡± he said, fudging a bit because Iris would
technically be the first in her class to sign up. There were other fish in the
pond, but no one had actually signed such a contract.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She read it and
signed it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As Wally stuffed it
back into his pocket, he said, ¡°Now, listen, Iris. I need your help. I need for
you to scope out other Krayoxx cases. Friends, family members, neighbors,
anyone else who may have been <a name=page87></a>injured by this drug. Our firm
is offering a referral fee of $500 for a death case and $200 for a non-death
case. Cash.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Her eyes were
suddenly dry. They narrowed, then a tiny smile formed at the corners of her
lips. She was already thinking of others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David managed to
maintain a lawyerly frown as he scribbled useless drivel on a legal pad and
tried to digest what he was hearing. Was this ethical? Legal? Cash bribes to
bring in more cases?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Do you happen to
know of another death case involving Krayoxx?¡± Wally asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Iris almost said
something but held her tongue. It was obvious she had a name. ¡°Five hundred
bucks, huh?¡± she said, her eyes suddenly darting from David¡¯s to Wally¡¯s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s the deal.
Who is it?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°There¡¯s a man two
blocks over, used to play poker with Percy, croaked last year in the shower two
months after my Percy passed. I know for a fact he was on Krayoxx.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally¡¯s eyes were
wild. ¡°What¡¯s his name?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You said cash,
right? Five hundred cash. I¡¯d like to see it, Mr. Figg, before I give you
another case. I sure need it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Stung for a second,
Wally rallied with a convincing lie. ¡°Well, normally we make a withdrawal from
the firm¡¯s litigation account, keeps the bean counters happy, you know?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She folded her
stump-like arms across her chest, stiffened her spine, narrowed her eyes, and
said, ¡°Fine. Go make your withdrawal and bring me the cash. Then I¡¯ll give you
the name.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was reaching
for his wallet. ¡°Well, I¡¯m not sure I have that much cash on me. David, how
liquid are you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David instinctively
reached for his wallet. Iris watched with great suspicion as the lawyers
scrambled to find cash. Wally produced three $20 bills and a $5 bill and looked
hopefully at David, who found $220 in assorted denominations. If they had not
stopped by Abner¡¯s to pay the tab, they could have come within $15 of covering
Iris¡¯s referral fee.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I thought lawyers
had plenty of money,¡± Iris observed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page88></a><span lang=EN>¡°We
keep it in the bank,¡± Wally shot back, unwilling to concede an inch. ¡°Looks
like we have about $285. I¡¯ll stop by tomorrow with the rest.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Iris was shaking
her head no.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Come on, Iris,¡±
Wally pleaded. ¡°You¡¯re now our client. We¡¯re on the same team. We¡¯re talking
about a huge settlement one day, and you won¡¯t trust us with two hundred
bucks?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll take an IOU,¡±
she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At this point,
David preferred to stand his ground, show some pride, rake the cash off the
table, and say good-bye. But David was anything but sure-footed, and he knew it
was not his call. Wally, on the other hand, was a rabid dog. He quickly
scribbled an IOU on his legal pad, signed his name, and slid it across the
table. Iris read it slowly, disapproved, then handed it to David. ¡°You sign it
too,¡± she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For the first time
since his great escape, David Zinc questioned his wisdom. Approximately
forty-eight hours earlier, he had been working on a complicated repackaging of
high-grade bonds being sold by the government of India. All told, the deal
involved around $15 billion. Now, in his new life as a street lawyer, he was
being bullied by a four-hundred-pound woman who was demanding his signature on
a worthless piece of paper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He hesitated, took
a deep breath, shot Wally a look of sheer bewilderment, then signed his name.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The
run-down neighborhood got dramatically worse the deeper they drove into it. The
¡°two blocks over¡± Iris had mentioned was more like five blocks, and by the time
they found the house and parked on the street in front of it, David was worried
about their safety.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The tiny home of
the widow Cozart was a fortress&#8212;a small brick house on a narrow lot lined with
eight-foot chain-link fencing. According to Iris, Herb Cozart was at war with
the black teenage thugs who roamed the streets. He spent most of his days
sitting on the front <a name=page89></a>porch holding a shotgun, glaring at the
punks and cursing them if they got too close. When he died, someone tied party
balloons along the fence. Someone else tossed a string of firecrackers onto the
front lawn in the middle of the night. Mrs. Cozart was planning to move,
according to Iris.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As David turned off
the ignition, he looked down the street and said, ¡°Oh, boy.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally froze, looked
in the same direction, and said, ¡°This could be interesting.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Five black males,
teenagers, all dressed in the appropriate rapper garb, had noticed the shiny
Audi and were giving it the once-over from fifty yards away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I think I¡¯ll stay
with the car,¡± David said. ¡°You can handle this one by yourself.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good call. I¡¯ll
make it quick.¡± Wally jumped out with his briefcase. Iris had called ahead, and
Mrs. Cozart was standing on the porch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The gang was moving
toward the Audi. David locked the doors and thought of how nice it would be to
have a pistol of some variety, just for protection. Something to show the boys
so they would take their fun and games elsewhere. But armed only with a cell
phone, he stuck it to his ear and pretended to be in deep conversation as the
gang moved closer and closer. They surrounded the car, chatting nonstop, though
David could not understand what they were saying. Minutes passed as David
waited for a brick to crash through a window. They regrouped at the front bumper,
and all five leaned back casually, as if they owned the car and needed to use
it as a resting place. They rocked it gently, careful not to scratch or damage
it. Then one of them lit a joint, and they passed it around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David thought about
starting the engine and attempting to drive away, but that would create several
problems, not the least of which was poor Wally getting stranded. He thought
about lowering a window and engaging the boys in friendly banter, but they did
not appear friendly at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page90></a><span lang=EN>From
the corner of his eye, David saw Mrs. Cozart¡¯s front door fly open and Wally
storm out of the house. Wally reached into his briefcase, yanked out a very
large black handgun, and yelled, ¡°FBI! Get off the damn car!¡± The boys were too
startled to move, or to move quickly enough, so Wally aimed at the clouds and
fired a shot that sounded like a cannon. The five bolted, scattered, vanished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally stuffed the
pistol into his briefcase and jumped into the car. ¡°Let¡¯s get outta here,¡± he
said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David was already
accelerating.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Punks,¡± Wally
hissed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Do you always
carry a gun?¡± David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I have a permit.
Yes, I always carry a gun. In this business, you might need one.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Do most lawyers
carry guns?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t care what
most lawyers do, okay? It¡¯s not my job to protect most lawyers. I¡¯ve been
mugged twice in this city, so I ain¡¯t getting mugged again.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David slid around a
curve and sped through the neighborhood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally continued,
¡°Crazy woman wanted some money. Iris, of course, called and said we were coming
over, and of course she told Mrs. Cozart about the referral fee, but since the
old gal is nuts, all she heard was the part about the five hundred bucks.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Did you sign her
up?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No. She demanded
cash, which is pretty stupid because Iris should know that she took all our
cash.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Where are we going
now?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°To the office. She
wouldn¡¯t even tell me her husband¡¯s date of death, so I figure we¡¯ll run a
search and find out. Why don¡¯t you do that when we get to the office?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But he¡¯s not our
client.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, he¡¯s dead. And
since his wife is crazy, and I mean this woman is really nuts, we can get a
court-appointed administrator to approve his lawsuit. More ways than one to
skin a cat, David. You¡¯ll learn.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page91></a><span lang=EN>¡°Oh,
I¡¯m learning. Isn¡¯t it against the law to discharge a firearm within the city
limits?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, well, they
did teach you something at Harvard. Yes, that¡¯s true, and it¡¯s also against the
law to discharge a firearm with a bullet that goes into the head of another
person. It¡¯s called murder, and it happens at least once a day here in Chicago.
And since there are so many murders, the police are overworked and have no time
to fool with firearms that discharge bullets that fly harmlessly through the
air. You thinking about turning me in or something?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No. Just curious.
Does Oscar carry a gun?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t think so,
but he keeps one in a desk drawer. Oscar was assaulted once, in his office, by
an irate divorce client. It was a simple no-fault divorce, uncontested on all
issues, and Oscar somehow found a way to lose the case.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How do you lose an

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t know, but
don¡¯t ask Oscar, okay? It¡¯s still a touchy subject. Anyway, he told the client

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oscar looks like
he can take care of himself. The guy must¡¯ve been a bad dude.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who said it was a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A woman?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yep. A very large
and angry woman, but a woman nonetheless. She got the drop on him by throwing
her coffee cup&#8212;ceramic, not paper&#8212;and hitting him between the eyes. Then she
grabbed his umbrella and started flailing away. Fourteen stitches. Vallie
Pennebaker was her name, never forget her.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who broke it up?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Rochelle finally
got back there&#8212;Oscar swears she took her time&#8212;and she pulled Vallie off and
settled her down. Then she called the cops, and they hauled Vallie away,
charged her with aggravated assault. She countered with a lawsuit for
malpractice. Took two years <a name=page92></a>and probably five thousand bucks
to get it all settled. Now Oscar keeps a piece in his desk.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>What would they
think at Rogan Rothberg? David asked himself. Lawyers carrying guns. Lawyers
claiming to be FBI agents and firing into the air. Lawyers being bloodied by
unhappy clients.</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>They returned to the apparent safety of the
office at 4:30. The printer was spitting out sheets of paper. Rochelle was at
the table sorting and arranging stacks of letters. ¡°What did you do to DeeAnna
Nuxhall?¡± she growled at Wally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Let¡¯s just say her

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was scanning
a letter from a stack on the table. He handed one to David, who took it and
began reading. He was immediately hooked by the opening: ¡°Beware of Krayoxx!¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Let¡¯s start
signing,¡± Wally said. ¡°I want these in the mail this afternoon. The clock is

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The letters were on
Finley &amp; Figg stationery and sent by the Honorable Wallis T. Figg, Attorney
and Counselor-at-Law. After the ¡°Sincerely¡± sign-off, there was room for only

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Start signing my

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Start signing my

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page94></a><span lang=EN>¡°No.
I hereby give you the authority to sign my name on these letters,¡± Wally said
slowly, as if speaking to an idiot. Then he looked at Rochelle and said, ¡°And
you too.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ve already
signed a hundred,¡± she said as she handed another letter to David. ¡°Look at
that signature. A first grader could do better.¡± And she was right. The
signature was an effortless scrawl that began with a wavy roll that was
probably meant to be a <span class=0Text>W</span> and then spiked dramatically
for either the <span class=0Text>T</span> or the <span class=0Text>F</span>.
David picked up one of the letters Wally had just signed and compared his
signature with Rochelle¡¯s forgery. They were slightly similar, but both were
illegible and indecipherable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, this is

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David sat down and
began experimenting with his scrawl. Rochelle was folding, stuffing, and
putting on stamps. After a few minutes, David asked, ¡°Who are these people?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°About twenty

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°If they¡¯re dead,

Neither David nor Rochelle saw the humor. A few minutes passed without a word.
David was thinking about his room upstairs and all the work it needed. Rochelle
was watching the clock, waiting on 5:00 p.m. Wally was happily casting a wider
net for new clients.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page95></a><span lang=EN>¡°What

problems with heart attacks or strokes, then we¡¯re down to about, say, five or
six cases. Maybe seven or eight, who knows. And if we believe, as I do, that each
case, especially a death, is worth a couple mill, then we¡¯re looking at a very
nice payday. I get the sense that nobody else around here believes me, but I¡¯m
not going to argue.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I haven¡¯t said a
word,¡± Rochelle replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Just curious.
That¡¯s all,¡± David said. A couple of minutes passed, then he asked, ¡°So when do
we file some big lawsuit?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally, the expert,
cleared his throat in preparation for a mini-seminar. ¡°Very soon. We have Iris
Klopeck signed up, so we could file tomorrow if we wanted. I plan to get
Chester Marino¡¯s widow on board as soon as the funeral is over. These letters
go out today; the phones¡¯ll start ringing in a day or so. With some luck, we
might have half a dozen cases in hand within a week, then we¡¯ll file. I¡¯ll
start drafting the lawsuit tomorrow. It¡¯s important to file quickly in these
mass tort cases. We¡¯ll drop the first bomb here in Chicago, get the headlines,
and every person on Krayoxx will toss the drug and give us a call.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh, brother,¡±
Rochelle said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡° ¡®Oh, brother¡¯ is
right. Wait till we get around to the settlement, and I¡¯ll show you another
¡®Oh, brother.¡¯ ¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°State or federal
court?¡± David asked, quick to throttle the bickering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good question, and
I¡¯d like for you to research the issue. If we go <a name=page96></a>into state
court, we can also sue the doctors who prescribed Krayoxx to our clients.
That¡¯s more defendants, but also more high-powered defense lawyers causing
trouble. Frankly, there¡¯s enough money at Varrick Labs to make us all happy, so
I¡¯m inclined to keep the doctors out of it. On the federal side, because the
Krayoxx litigation will go nationwide, we can plug into the mass tort network
and ride their coattails. No one really expects these cases to go to trial, and
when the settlement negotiations begin, we need to be hooked in with the big
boys.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Again, Wally
sounded so knowledgeable that David wanted to believe him. But he¡¯d already
been at the firm long enough to know that Wally had never handled a mass tort
case. Nor had Oscar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar¡¯s door
opened, and he emerged with his usual frown and look of fatigue. ¡°What the hell
is this?¡± he said pleasantly. No one responded. He walked to the table, picked
up a letter, then dropped it. He was about to say something when the front door
burst open and a tall, thick, burly, tattooed Philistine stomped in and yelled
at the entire room, ¡°Which one is Figg!?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With no hesitation,
Oscar and David and even Rochelle pointed at Wally, who was wild-eyed and
frozen. Behind the intruder was a tart in a yellow dress, DeeAnna Nuxhall from
divorce court, and she yelled, ¡°That¡¯s him, Trip, the short fat one!¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Trip went straight
for Wally as if he might kill him. The rest of the firm scrambled away from the
table, leaving Wally to fend for himself. Trip made a couple of fists, hovered
over Wally, and said, ¡°Look, Figg, you little weasel! We¡¯re getting married
Saturday, so my girl here needs her divorce tomorrow. What¡¯s the problem?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally, still seated
and hunkering down in anticipation of a beating, said, ¡°Well, I would like to
get paid.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She promised to
pay you later, didn¡¯t she?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I sure did,¡±
DeeAnna added helpfully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°If you touch me,
I¡¯ll have you arrested,¡± Wally said. ¡°You can¡¯t get married if you¡¯re in jail.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page97></a><span lang=EN>¡°I
told you he was a smart-ass,¡± DeeAnna said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Because he needed
to hit something but was not quite ready to slap Wally around, Trip backhanded
a stack of Krayoxx letters and sent them flying. ¡°Get the divorce, okay, Figg!
I¡¯ll be there tomorrow, in court, and if my girl doesn¡¯t get her divorce then,
I¡¯ll stomp your chubby little ass right there in the courtroom.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Call the police,¡±
Oscar barked at Rochelle, who was too frightened to move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Trip needed
something with more drama, so he grabbed a thick law book off the table and
tossed it through a front window. Glass shattered and rattled across the porch.
AC yelped but retreated to a hiding place under Rochelle¡¯s desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Trip¡¯s eyes were
shiny and glazed. ¡°I¡¯ll snap your neck, Figg. You got that?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Hit him, Trip,¡±
DeeAnna urged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David glanced at
the sofa and saw Wally¡¯s briefcase. He eased closer to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯ll be in court
tomorrow, Figg. You gonna be there?¡± Trip took another step closer. Wally
braced for the assault. Rochelle moved in the direction of her desk, and this
upset Trip. ¡°Don¡¯t move! You¡¯re not calling the cops!¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Call the police,¡±
Oscar barked again, but made no effort to do so himself. David inched closer to
the briefcase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Talk to me, Figg,¡±
Trip demanded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He embarrassed me
in open court,¡± DeeAnna whined. It was obvious she wanted bloodshed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re a
slimeball, Figg, you know that?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was about to
say something clever when Trip finally made contact. He pushed Wally, a rather
benign little shove that seemed tame in light of the buildup, but it was an
assault nonetheless. ¡°Hey, watch it!¡± Wally barked, slapping at Trip¡¯s hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David quickly
opened the briefcase and withdrew the long black .44 Magnum Colt. He was not
certain if he had ever touched a revolver, <a name=page98></a>and he wasn¡¯t
sure he could do so now without blowing his hand off, but he knew to avoid the
trigger. ¡°Here, Wally,¡± he said as he placed the gun on the table. Wally
snatched it and jumped from his chair, and the rules of engagement changed
dramatically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Trip blurted ¡°Holy
shit!¡± in a high-pitched voice and took a long step back. DeeAnna ducked behind
him, whimpering. Rochelle and Oscar were as stunned as Trip was by the weapon.
Wally did not aim the gun at anyone, not directly anyway, but he handled it in
such a way that there was little doubt he could and would unload a few rounds
in a matter of seconds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°First, I want an apology,¡±
he said as he moved toward Trip, who had lost his swagger. ¡°You got a lotta
balls coming in here and making demands when your girl there won¡¯t pay her
bills.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Trip, who no doubt
had some experience in handguns, stared at the Colt and said meekly, ¡°Yeah,
sure, you¡¯re right, man.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Call the police,
Ms. Gibson,¡± Wally said, and she dialed 911. AC poked his head out and growled
at Trip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I want three
hundred bucks for the divorce and two hundred bucks for the window,¡± Wally
demanded. Trip was still backing away, with DeeAnna practically unseen behind
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Be cool, man,¡±
Trip said, both palms facing Wally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh, I¡¯m very
cool.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Do something,
baby,¡± DeeAnna said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Like what? You see
the size of that thing?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Can¡¯t we just get
outta here?¡± she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No,¡± Wally
replied. ¡°Not until the cops get here.¡± He raised the gun a few inches, careful
not to point it directly at Trip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle backed
away from her desk and went to the kitchen. ¡°Be cool, man,¡± Trip pleaded.
¡°We¡¯re leaving.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No you¡¯re not.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The
police arrived in minutes. Trip was handcuffed and placed in the backseat of a
patrol car. DeeAnna cried without effect, then she tried <a name=page99></a>flirting
with the cops, and this proved slightly more useful. In the end, though, Trip
was hauled away to face charges of assault and vandalism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When the excitement
was over, Rochelle and Oscar went home, leaving Wally and David to sweep up the
broken glass and finish signing the Krayoxx letters. They worked for an hour,
mindlessly signing Wally¡¯s name and also discussing what to do about the broken
window. It could not be replaced until the following day, and the office
wouldn¡¯t survive the night with a missing window. Preston wasn¡¯t a dangerous
neighborhood, but no one left keys in cars or doors unlocked. Wally had just
made the decision to sleep at the office, on the sofa, next to the table, with
AC nearby and the Colt within reach, when the front door swung open and dear
DeeAnna popped in for the second time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What are you doing
here?¡± Wally demanded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We need to talk,
Wally,¡± she said in a voice that was unsteady and much softer. She sat in a
chair near Rochelle¡¯s desk and crossed her legs in such a way as to leave most
of the flesh exposed. She had very nice legs and was wearing the same hooker¡¯s
heels she had displayed in court that morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Ooh la la,¡± Wally
said under his breath. Then, ¡°And what would you like to talk about?¡± he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I think she¡¯s been
drinking,¡± David whispered as he kept signing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m not sure I
should marry Trip,¡± she announced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He¡¯s a brute, a
real loser, DeeAnna. You can do better than that.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But I really want
my divorce, Wally, can¡¯t you help me out here?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Then pay me.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I can¡¯t get the
money before court tomorrow. I swear that¡¯s the truth.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Then too bad.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David decided that,
had the case been his, he would do whatever necessary to get the divorce so
DeeAnna and Trip would be history. An extra $300 wasn¡¯t worth all the hassle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She recrossed her
legs, and her skirt inched up even higher. ¡°I was thinking, Wally, that maybe
we could make some other arrangements. You know, just me and you.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page100></a><span
lang=EN>Wally sighed, looked at the legs, thought for a second, and said,
¡°Can¡¯t do it. I gotta stay here tonight because some jackass knocked out the
front window.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Then I¡¯ll stay
too,¡± she cooed, licking her bright red lips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally had never
possessed the willpower to run from these situations, not that he encountered
them all the time. Seldom had a client been so open and obvious. In fact, he
could not, at that dreadful yet thrilling moment, remember one being so easy.
¡°We might work something out,¡± he said, leering at DeeAnna.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m outta here,¡±
David said, jumping to his feet and grabbing his briefcase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You can hang
around,¡± she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The visual was
instantaneous and ugly&#8212;happily married David romping around with a cute slut
who¡¯d had as many divorces as her chubby and naked lawyer. David ran for the
door and slammed it behind him.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Their
favorite late-night bistro was within walking distance of their home in Lincoln
Park. They had often met there for a quick dinner just before the kitchen
closed at eleven, just as David staggered home from another crushing day at the
office. Tonight, though, they arrived before nine and found the place bustling.
Their table was in a corner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At some point,
about halfway through his five-year career at Rogan Rothberg, David had adopted
the policy of not discussing his work, of never bringing it home. It was so
unpleasant and distasteful, and boring to boot, he simply could not dump it on
Helen. She happily went along with this policy, and so they usually talked
about her studies or what their friends were doing. But things were suddenly
different. The big firm was gone, as were the faceless clients and their
tedious files. Now David worked with real people who did incredible things that
had to be retold in great detail. Take, for example, the two near gun-fights
David had survived with his sidekick, Wally. At first, Helen flatly <a
name=page101></a>refused to believe that Wally had actually fired a shot in the
air to scatter the street thugs, but she eventually softened under David¡¯s
relentless narrative. Nor did she believe the Trip story on the first telling.
She was equally skeptical of the Wally&#8211;Judge Bradbury shakedown of DeeAnna
Nuxhall in open court. She was incredulous that her husband would fork over all
of his cash to Iris Klopeck, then sign an IOU for more. Oscar getting mauled by
an angry (female) divorce client was slightly more believable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Saving the best for
last, David wrapped up his unforgettable first day at Finley &amp; Figg with:
¡°And, dear, even as we speak, Wally and DeeAnna are naked on the sofa having a
romp with the window open and the dog watching and the unpaid fee getting
satisfied in spectacular fashion.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re lying.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I wish. The $300
will be forgiven, and DeeAnna will be divorced by noon tomorrow.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What a
sleazeball.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Which one?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How about both? Do
most of your clients pay this way?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I doubt it. I
mentioned Iris Klopeck. I suspect she¡¯s more in line with the firm¡¯s client
profile. The fee couch couldn¡¯t hold up under the pounding.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You can¡¯t work for
these people, David. Come on. Quit Rogan if you want, but let¡¯s find a
different firm somewhere. These two clowns are a couple of crooks. What about
ethics?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I doubt if they
spend much time discussing ethics.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Why not look for a
nice midsized firm somewhere, with nice people who don¡¯t carry guns and chase
ambulances and swap labor for sex?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What¡¯s my
specialty, Helen?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Something to do
with bonds.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Right. I know a
lot about high-yield, long-term bonds issued by foreign governments and
corporations. That¡¯s all I know about the law because that¡¯s all I¡¯ve done for
the past five years. Put that on a <a name=page102></a>r&eacute;sum&eacute;, and the only
people who might call are a handful of eggheads at other large firms, just like
Rogan, who might be in need of someone like me.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But you can
learn.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Of course I can,
but no one will hire a five-year lawyer at a nice salary and put him in
kindergarten. They demand experience, and I don¡¯t have it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So Finley &amp;
Figg is the only place you can work?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Or someplace like

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Wally¡¯s mass-mailing scheme proved futile. Half
of the letters were returned by the postal service for a variety of reasons.
Phone traffic spiked a bit in the week that followed, though most of the calls
were from former clients who demanded to be removed from Finley &amp; Figg¡¯s
mailing list. Undaunted, Wally filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois, naming Iris Klopeck and Millie Marino, as
well as ¡°others to be named later,¡± and claimed their loved ones had been
killed by the drug Krayoxx, manufactured by Varrick Labs. Throwing darts, Wally
asked for an even $100 million in total damages, and he demanded a trial by
jury.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The filing was not
nearly as dramatic as he wished. He tried desperately to attract the media to
the lawsuit he was brewing, but there was little interest. Instead of simply
filing it online, he and David, both dressed in their finest dark suits, drove
to the Everett M. Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in downtown Chicago and hand delivered
the twenty-page lawsuit to the clerk. There were no reporters and no
photographers, and this upset Wally. He harangued a deputy clerk into snapping
a photograph of the two grim-faced lawyers as they filed the lawsuit. Once back
at the office, he e-mailed the lawsuit and the photograph to the <span
class=0Text>Tribune</span>, the <span class=0Text>Sun-Times</span>, the <span
class=0Text>Wall Street Journal</span>, <span class=0Text>Time</span>, <span
class=0Text>Newsweek</span>, and a dozen other publications.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David prayed the
photograph would go unnoticed, but Wally got lucky. A reporter from the <span
class=0Text>Tribune</span> called the office and was immediately <a
name=page104></a>put through to an ecstatic Attorney Figg. The avalanche of
publicity began.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On the front page
of Section B the following morning, a headline read: ¡°Chicago Attorney Attacks
Varrick Labs over Krayoxx.¡± The article summarized the lawsuit and said local
attorney Wally Figg was a ¡°self-described mass tort specialist.¡± Finley &amp;
Figg was a ¡°boutique firm¡± with a long history of fighting big drug companies.
The reporter, though, did some sniffing and quoted two well-known plaintiffs¡¯
lawyers as saying, in effect, we¡¯ve never heard of these guys. And there was no
record of similar lawsuits filed by Finley &amp; Figg during the past ten
years. Varrick responded aggressively by defending its product, promising a
vigorous defense, and ¡°looking forward to a fair trial before an impartial jury
to clear our good name.¡± The reproduced photograph was rather large. This
tickled Wally and embarrassed David. They were quite a pair: Wally was balding,
rotund, and badly dressed, while David was taller, trimmer, and much younger
looking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The story went wild
on the Internet, and the phone rang nonstop. At times, Rochelle was overwhelmed
and David helped out. Some of the callers were reporters, others were lawyers
sniffing around for information, but most were Krayoxx users who were terrified
and confused. David wasn¡¯t sure what to say. The firm¡¯s strategy, if it could
be called that, was to pick through the net and take the death cases, then at
some undefined point in the future corral the ¡°non-death¡± clients and lump them
into a class action. This was impossible to explain over the phone because
David didn¡¯t quite grasp it himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As the phones rang
and the excitement continued, even Oscar came out of his office and showed some
interest. His little firm had never seen such activity, and, well, maybe this
was indeed their big moment. Maybe Wally was finally right about something.
Maybe, just maybe, this could lead to real money, which meant at long last the
divorce he so fervently wanted, followed immediately by retirement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The three lawyers
met at the table late in the day to compare notes. Wally was wired, even
perspiring. He waved his legal pad in the air and <a name=page105></a>said, ¡°We
got four death cases here, brand-new ones, and we gotta sign ¡¯em up right now.
Are you in, Oscar?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure, I¡¯ll take
one,¡± Oscar said, trying to appear reluctant as always.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thank you. Now,
Ms. Gibson, there¡¯s a black lady who lives on Nineteenth, not far from you,
Bassitt Towers, number three. She says it¡¯s safe.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I will not go to
Bassitt Towers,¡± Rochelle said. ¡°I can practically hear the gunfire from my
apartment.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s my point.
It¡¯s right down the street from you. You could stop by on the way home.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I will not.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally slammed his
legal pad onto the table. ¡°Can¡¯t you see what¡¯s happening here, damn it? These
people are begging us to take their cases, cases that are worth millions of
bucks. There could be a huge settlement within a year. We¡¯re on the verge of
something big here, and you, as always, couldn¡¯t care less.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I will not risk my
neck for this law firm.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Great. So when
Varrick settles and the cash pours in, you will forgo your share of the bonus.
That¡¯s what you¡¯re telling us?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What bonus?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally walked to the
front door and back to the table, pacing. ¡°Well, well, how quickly we forget.
Remember the Sherman case last year, Ms. Gibson? Nice little car wreck, a
rear-ender. State Farm paid sixty grand. We took a third, a nice fee of twenty
thousand for good ol¡¯ Finley &amp; Figg. We paid some bills. I took seven
grand, Oscar took seven, and we gave you a thousand bucks cash under the table.
Didn¡¯t we, Oscar?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, and we¡¯ve
done it before,¡± Oscar said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle was
calculating as Wally was talking. It would be a shame to miss a piece of the
lottery. What if Wally was right for a change? He shut up, and things were
quiet and tense for a moment as the air cleared. AC rose to his feet and began
growling. Seconds passed, then <a name=page106></a>the distant sound of an
ambulance could be heard. It grew louder, but, oddly, no one moved to the
window or to the front porch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Had they already
lost interest in their bread and butter? Had the little boutique firm suddenly
outgrown car wrecks and moved on to a far more lucrative field?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How much of a
bonus?¡± she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Come on, Ms.
Gibson,¡± Wally said, exasperated. ¡°I have no idea.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What do I tell
this poor woman?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally picked up his
legal pad. ¡°I talked to her an hour ago, name¡¯s Pauline Sutton, age sixty-two.
Her forty-year-old son, Jermaine, died of a heart attack seven months ago, said
he was a bit on the heavy side, took Krayoxx for four years to lower his
cholesterol. A charming lady but also a grieving mother. Take one of our
brand-new Krayoxx contracts for legal services, explain it to her, sign her up.
Piece of cake.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What if she has
questions about the lawsuit and settlement?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Make an
appointment and get her in here. I¡¯ll answer her questions. What¡¯s important is
getting her signed up. We¡¯ve created a hornet¡¯s nest here in Chicago. Every
half-assed ambulance chaser in the business is now loose on the streets looking
for Krayoxx victims. Time is of the essence. Can you do it, Ms. Gibson?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I suppose.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thank you so much.
Now, I suggest we all hit the streets.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Their
first stop was an all-you-can-eat pizza house not far from the office. The
restaurant was owned by a chain, a somewhat infamous company that was suffering
through a firestorm of bad press caused entirely by its menu. A leading health
magazine had analyzed its food and declared it all hazardous and unfit for
human consumption. Everything was drenched with grease, oils, and additives,
and no effort was made to cook anything even remotely healthy. Once the food
was ready, it was served buffet style and offered at ridiculously low prices.
The chain had become synonymous with hordes of morbidly obese people feeding at
its buffet troughs. Profits were soaring.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page107></a><span
lang=EN>The assistant manager was a plump young man named Adam Grand, and he
asked them to wait ten minutes before he could take a break. David and Wally
found a booth as far away from the buffet tables as possible, which wasn¡¯t far
at all. The booth was roomy and wide, and David realized that everything in the
place was oversized&#8212;plates, glasses, napkins, tables, chairs, booths. Wally was
on his cell phone, eagerly lining up another meeting with a potential client.
David could not help but watch the enormous people digging through piles of
thick pizza. He almost felt sorry for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Adam Grand slid in
beside David and said, ¡°You got five minutes. My boss is yelling back there.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally wasted no
time. ¡°You told me on the phone that your mother died six months ago, heart
attack. She was sixty-six and took Krayoxx for a couple of years. How about
your father?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Died three years
ago.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sorry. Krayoxx,
perhaps?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, colon cancer.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Brothers,
sisters?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°One brother who
lives in Peru. He will not be involved in any of this.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David and Wally
were scribbling away. David felt as though he should say something important,
but had nothing on his mind. He was there as the chauffeur. Wally was about to
ask another question when Adam threw a curveball. ¡°Say, I just talked to
another lawyer.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally¡¯s spine
straightened; his eyes widened. ¡°Oh, really. What¡¯s his name?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He said he was a
Krayoxx expert, and he could get us a million bucks, no sweat. Is that true?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was ready for
combat. ¡°He¡¯s lying. If he promised you a million bucks, then he¡¯s an idiot. We
can¡¯t promise anything in the way of money. What we can promise is that we¡¯ll
provide the best legal representation you can find.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure, sure, but I
like the idea of a lawyer telling me how much I might get, know what I mean?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page108></a><span
lang=EN>¡°We can get you a lot more than a million bucks,¡± Wally promised.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Now we¡¯re talking.
How long will this take?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A year, maybe
two,¡± Wally promised again. He was sliding across a contract. ¡°Look this over.
It¡¯s a contract between our firm and you as the legal representative of your
mother¡¯s estate.¡± Adam scanned it quickly and said, ¡°Nothing up front, right?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh no, we front
the litigation expenses.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Forty percent for
you guys is pretty steep.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was shaking
his head. ¡°That¡¯s the industry average. All standard. Any lawyer doing mass
torts who¡¯s worth his salt is getting 40 percent. Some want 50, but not us. I
think 50¡¯s unethical.¡± He looked at David for confirmation, and David nodded
and frowned at the thought of those shady lawyers out there who possessed
questionable ethics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I guess so,¡± Adam
said, then signed his name. Wally snatched the contract and said, ¡°Great, Adam,
good move and welcome aboard. We¡¯ll add this case to our lawsuit and kick
things into high gear. Any questions?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yeah, what should
I tell this other lawyer?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Tell him you went
with the best, Finley &amp; Figg.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re in good
hands, Adam,¡± David said solemnly, and immediately realized he sounded like a
bad commercial. Wally shot him a look that said, ¡°Seriously?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I guess that
remains to be seen, doesn¡¯t it?¡± Adam said. ¡°We¡¯ll know when the big check gets
here. You promised more than a million, Mr. Figg, and I take you at your word.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You won¡¯t be
sorry.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°See you,¡± Adam said
and disappeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was stuffing
his legal pad into his briefcase when he said, ¡°That was easy.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You just
guaranteed the guy something over a million. Is that wise?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No. But if that¡¯s
what it takes, then that¡¯s what it takes. Here¡¯s how it works, young David. You
sign ¡¯em up, get ¡¯em on board, keep ¡¯em happy, and when there¡¯s money on the
table, they¡¯ll forget about what <a name=page109></a>you said up front. Say,
for example, a year from now Varrick gets sick of its Krayoxx mess and throws
in the towel. Let¡¯s say our new pal Adam here is due less than a million, pick
a number&#8212;$750,000. Now, do you really believe that loser will walk away from
that much money?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Probably not.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Exactly. He¡¯ll be
one happy boy, and he¡¯ll forget about anything we said today. That¡¯s how it
works.¡± Wally took a long, hungry look at the buffet bars. ¡°Say, you got plans
for dinner? I¡¯m starving.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David had no plans,
but he would not be eating there. ¡°Yeah, my wife¡¯s waiting for a late snack.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally looked again
at the troughs and the hulking masses of people grazing there. He froze for a
second, then cracked a smile. ¡°What a great idea,¡± he said, complimenting
himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m sorry.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Look at those
people. What¡¯s the average weight?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I have no idea.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Neither do I, but
if I¡¯m a bit pudgy at 240, those folks are well over 400 pounds.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re losing me,
Wally.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Look at the
obvious, David. This place is packed with grossly overweight people, half of
whom are probably on Krayoxx. I¡¯ll bet if I yelled out right now, ¡®Who¡¯s on
Krayoxx?¡¯ half of these poor bastards would raise their hands.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Don¡¯t do that.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m not, but don¡¯t
you see my point?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You want to start
handing out cards?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, smart-ass, but
there must be a way to screen these people for Krayoxx users.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But they¡¯re not
dead yet.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It won¡¯t be long.
Look, we can add them to our second lawsuit of non-death cases.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m missing
something here, Wally. Help me. Aren¡¯t we required to prove, at some point,
that the drug actually causes some type of damage?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page110></a><span
lang=EN>¡°Sure, and we¡¯ll prove it later when we hire our experts. Right now,
the important thing is to get everybody signed up. It¡¯s a horse race out here,
David. We gotta figure out a way to screen these folks and sign them up.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Six o¡¯clock was
approaching, and the restaurant was packed. David and Wally had the only booth
not being used for dinner. A large family of four approached, each holding two
platters of pizza. They stopped at the booth and cast menacing looks at the two
lawyers. This was serious business.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Their
next stop was a duplex in a neighborhood near Midway Airport. David parked at
the curb, behind an ancient Volkswagen Beetle on blocks. Wally was saying,
¡°Frank Schmidt, age fifty-two when he succumbed last year to a massive stroke.
I spoke with his widow, Agnes.¡± But David was only half listening. He was
trying to convince himself that he was really doing this&#8212;scrambling around the
rough spots of Chicago¡¯s Southwest Side with his new boss, who couldn¡¯t drive
because of problems, after dark, on the lookout for street thugs, knocking on strange
doors of untidy homes, not knowing what was inside, all in an effort to hustle
clients before the next lawyer came along. What would his friends from Harvard
Law think about it? How hard would they laugh? But David decided he really
didn¡¯t care. Any law job was better than his old one, and most of his friends
from law school were miserable. He, on the other hand, had been liberated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Agnes Schmidt was
either hiding or not at home. No one came to the door, and the two lawyers
hurried away. As he drove, David said, ¡°Look, Wally, I really would like to get
home and see my wife. I haven¡¯t seen her much in the past five years. Time to
catch up.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She¡¯s very cute. I
don¡¯t blame you.¡±</span></p>

<p class=0Block style='page-break-before:always'><a name="Top_of_part0016_html"></a><a

CHAPTER_14'><span lang=EN>CHAPTER 14</span></span></h1>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Within a week of filing its lawsuit, the firm had
a total of eight death cases, a respectable number and one that would certainly
make them rich. Because Wally said it so often, it had become the accepted
belief that each case meant roughly half a million dollars in net fees to
Finley &amp; Figg. His math was shaky and riddled with assumptions that had
little basis in reality, at least at such a preliminary stage of the
litigation, but the three lawyers and Rochelle began to think in terms of that
kind of money. Krayoxx was making news around the country, none of it positive,
and its future looked ominous, as far as Varrick Labs was concerned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The firm had worked
so hard to get the cases, it was a shock to realize they could actually lose
one. Millie Marino arrived at the office one morning in a foul mood and
demanded to see Mr. Figg. She had hired him to probate her husband¡¯s estate,
and then she had reluctantly agreed to pursue a Krayoxx claim for his death. In
Wally¡¯s office, behind closed doors, she explained she could not resolve the
fact that one lawyer in the firm&#8212;Oscar&#8212;had prepared a will that kept a sizable
asset&#8212;the baseball card collection&#8212;out of her reach, and now the other
lawyer&#8212;Wally&#8212;was probating that same will. This, in her opinion, was a glaring
conflict of interest, and downright sleazy to boot. She was upset and began
crying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally tried to
explain that lawyers are bound by rules of confidentiality. When Oscar prepared
the will, he had to do what Chester <a name=page112></a>wanted, and since
Chester wanted his baseball cards hidden until after his death, then given to
his son, Lyle, so be it. Ethically, Oscar could not divulge any information to
anyone about Chester and his will.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Millie didn¡¯t see
it that way. As his wife, she had a right to know about all of his assets,
especially something as valuable as his cards. She had already talked to a
dealer, and the Shoeless Joe card alone was worth at least $100,000. The entire
collection might fetch $150,000.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally really didn¡¯t
give a damn about the baseball cards, or the estate for that matter. The $5,000
fee he had once contemplated was now peanuts. He had a Krayoxx case on the line
here, and he would say or do anything to keep it. ¡°Frankly,¡± he said gravely as
he glanced at his door, ¡°between the two of us, I would have handled it
differently, but Mr. Finley comes from the old school.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Meaning what?¡± she
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He¡¯s pretty
chauvinistic. The husband is the head of the house, keeper of all assets, the
only decision maker, you know the type. If the man wants to hide things from
his wife, nothing wrong with that. Me, I¡¯m much more liberated.¡± He followed
this with a nervous laugh that was confusing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But it¡¯s too
late,¡± she said. ¡°The will has been written. Now it¡¯s going to probate.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°True, Millie, but
things will work out. Your husband left his baseball cards to his son, but he left
you with a beautiful lawsuit.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A beautiful what?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You know, the
Krayoxx thing.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh, that. Yes, I¡¯m
not too happy with that either. I¡¯ve talked to another lawyer, and he says
you¡¯re in over your head, says you¡¯ve never handled a case like this.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally gasped for
air, then managed to ask, in a squeaky voice, ¡°Why are you talking to other
lawyers?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Because he called
me the other night. I checked him out online. He¡¯s in a big firm with offices
all over the country, and all they do is sue drug companies. I¡¯m thinking about
hiring him.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Don¡¯t do that,
Millie. These guys are famous for signing up a <a name=page113></a>thousand
cases, then screwing their clients. You¡¯ll never talk to him again, just some
young paralegal in the back room. It¡¯s a scam, I swear it is. You can always
get me on the phone.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t want to
talk to you on the phone, or in person either.¡± She was on her feet, gathering
her handbag.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Please, Millie.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll think about
it, Figg, but I¡¯m not happy.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ten minutes after
she left, Iris Klopeck called and asked to borrow $5,000 against her portion of
the Krayoxx settlement. Wally sat at his desk with his head in his hands and

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally¡¯s
lawsuit was assigned to the Honorable Harry Seawright, a Reagan appointee who
had been on the federal bench for almost thirty years. He was eighty-one,
anticipating retirement, and not too excited about a lawsuit that could take a
few years to resolve and eat up his calendar in the process. But he was
curious. His favorite nephew had been taking Krayoxx for several years, with
great success and no side effects at all. Not surprisingly, Judge Seawright had
never heard of the law firm of Finley &amp; Figg. He directed his law clerk to
check out the firm, and the clerk¡¯s e-mail read: ¡°A 2 man ham and egg operation
on Preston, Southwest Side; advertises for quickie divorces, DUIs, the usual
criminal, domestic, injury practice; no record of any filings in federal court
in the past 10 years; no record of jury trials in state court in past 10 years,
no bar association activity; they do occasionally go to court&#8212;Figg has either 2
or 3 DUIs in past 12 years; firm was once sued for sexual harassment, settled.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Seawright was
incredulous. He e-mailed his clerk: ¡°These guys have no trial experience, yet
they filed a $100 million lawsuit against the third-largest pharmaceutical
company in the world?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The clerk
responded: ¡°Correct.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright:
¡°Insane! What¡¯s behind this?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The clerk: ¡°Krayoxx
stampede. It¡¯s the latest and hottest bad drug <a name=page114></a>in the
country; mass tort bar is in frenzy. Finley &amp; Figg probably hopes to ride
coattails all the way to a settlement.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright:
¡°Keep digging.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Later the clerk
responded: ¡°The lawsuit is signed by Finley &amp; Figg, but also a third
lawyer&#8212;David E. Zinc, former associate at Rogan Rothberg; I called a friend
there&#8212;said Zinc cracked up, bolted ten days ago, somehow landed out there at
FF; no litigation experience; guess he found the right place.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright:
¡°Let¡¯s watch this case closely.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The clerk: ¡°As
always.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Varrick
Labs was headquartered in a baffling series of glass and steel buildings in a
forest near Montville, New Jersey. The complex was the work of a once famous
architect who had since repudiated his own design. It was occasionally praised
as daring and futuristic, but much more often it was denounced as drab,
hideous, bunker-like, Soviet style, and a lot of other unkind words. In several
ways it resembled a fortress, surrounded by trees, away from the traffic and
crowds, protected. Because Varrick got sued so often, its headquarters seemed
fitting. The company was hunkered down out there in the woods, braced for the
next assault.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Its CEO was Reuben
Massey, a company man who had led Varrick for many years, through turbulent
times, and always to impressive profits. Varrick was in a constant state of war
with the mass tort bar, and while other pharmaceuticals wilted or folded under waves
of litigation, Massey managed to keep his stockholders happy. He knew when to
fight, when to settle, how to settle cheap, and how to appeal to the lawyers¡¯
greed while saving his company tons of money. During his term, Varrick had
survived (1) a $400 million settlement for a denture cream that caused zinc
poisoning; (2) a $450 million settlement for a stool softener that backfired
and clogged things up; (3) a $700 million settlement for a blood thinner that
cooked a bunch of livers; (4) a $1.2 billion settlement for a migraine remedy
that allegedly caused high <a name=page115></a>blood pressure; (5) a $2.2
billion settlement for a high blood pressure pill that allegedly caused
migraines; (6) a $2.3 billion settlement for a painkiller that was instantly
addictive; and, worst of all, (7) a $3 billion settlement for a diet pill that
caused blindness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was a long, sad
list, and Varrick Labs had paid dearly in the court of public opinion. Reuben
Massey, though, continually reminded his troops of the hundreds of innovative
and effective drugs they created and sold to the world. What he did not talk
about, except in the boardroom, was the fact that Varrick had profited from
every drug that had been targeted by the plaintiffs¡¯ lawyers. So far, the
company had won the battle, even after forking over huge settlements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Krayoxx, however,
could be different. There were now four lawsuits; the first one in Fort
Lauderdale, the second in Chicago, and now two new ones in Texas and Brooklyn.
Massey closely monitored the workings and dealings of the mass tort bar. He
spent time each day with his in-house lawyers, studying the lawsuits, reading
the bar journals and newsletters and blogs, and talking to his lawyers in big
firms across the country. One of the most revealing signals in any looming war
was TV advertising. When the lawyers began bombarding the airwaves with their
sleazy, get-rich-quick come-ons, Massey knew Varrick was in for another
expensive brawl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Krayoxx ads were
popping up everywhere. The frenzy had begun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Massey had worried
about a few of Varrick¡¯s other targets. The migraine pill was a huge blunder,
and he still cursed himself for ramming it through research and approvals. The
blood thinner almost got him fired. But he had never doubted Krayoxx, nor would
he ever. Varrick had spent $4 billion developing the drug. It had been tested
extensively in clinical trials in third-world countries; the results had been
spectacular. Its research was thorough and immaculate. Its pedigree was
flawless. Krayoxx caused no more strokes and heart attacks than the daily
vitamin pill, and Varrick had a mountain of research to prove it.</span></p>

<p class=Para06 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.5pt'><span lang=EN>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page116></a><span
lang=EN>The daily legal briefing was held at precisely 9:30 in the Varrick
boardroom on the fifth floor of a building that resembled a Kansas wheat silo.
Reuben Massey was a stickler for punctuality, and his eight in-house lawyers
were in their seats by 9:15. The team was led by Nicholas Walker, a former U.S.
attorney, former Wall Street litigator, and the current mastermind behind every
defense Varrick erected to protect itself. When the lawsuits began dropping
like cluster bombs, Walker and Reuben Massey spent hours together, coolly
responding, analyzing, scheming, and directing counterattacks when necessary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Massey entered the
room at 9:25, picked up an agenda, and said, ¡°What¡¯s the latest?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Krayoxx or
Faladin?¡± Walker asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Gee, I almost
forgot about Faladin. Let¡¯s stick to Krayoxx for the moment.¡± Faladin was an
antiwrinkle cream that was allegedly causing wrinkles, according to a few
loudmouthed lawyers on the West Coast. The litigation had yet to gain momentum,
primarily because the lawyers were finding it difficult to measure wrinkleness,
before and after.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nicholas Walker
said, ¡°Well, the gates are open. Snowball¡¯s rolling down the mountain. Pick
your metaphor. All hell¡¯s breaking loose. I chatted with Alisandros at Zell
&amp; Potter yesterday, and they¡¯re getting flooded with new cases. He plans to
push hard to establish multi-district in Florida and keep his finger on
things.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Alisandros. Why do
the same thieves show up at every heist?¡± Massey asked. ¡°Haven¡¯t we paid them
enough over the past twenty years?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Evidently not.
He¡¯s built his own golf course, for Zell &amp; Potter lawyers only and a few
lucky friends, and he invited me to come down and play. Eighteen holes.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Please go, Nick.
We need to see how wisely our money is being invested by these thugs.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Will do. I got a
phone call late yesterday afternoon from Amanda Petrocelli in Reno, says she¡¯s
hooked her a few death clients, putting together a class, and will file suit
either today or tomorrow. I told her <a name=page117></a>it really didn¡¯t
matter to us when she filed suit. We can expect more filings this week and
next.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Krayoxx is not
causing strokes and heart attacks,¡± Massey said. ¡°I believe in this drug.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The eight lawyers
nodded their heads in agreement. Reuben Massey was not one to make bold
statements or false claims. He had doubts about Faladin, and Varrick would
eventually settle for a few million, long before a trial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Number two on the
legal team was a woman named Judy Beck, another veteran of the mass tort wars.
She said, ¡°All of us feel the same, Reuben. Our research is better than theirs,
if they actually have any. Our experts are better. Our proof is better. Our
lawyers will be better. Perhaps it¡¯s time we counterattack and throw everything
we have at the enemy.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°My thoughts
exactly, Judy,¡± Massey said. ¡°You guys have a strategy?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nicholas Walker
said, ¡°It¡¯s evolving, but for now we go through the same motions, make the same
public comments, watch and wait and see who files what and where. We look at
the lawsuits, study the judges and the jurisdictions, and we pick our spot.
When the stars are all aligned&#8212;the right plaintiff, the right city, the right
judge&#8212;then we hire the hottest gunslinger in town and push hard for a trial.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°This has
backfired, you know,¡± Massey said. ¡°Don¡¯t forget Klervex. That cost us two
billion.¡± Their miracle blood pressure pill was destined for greatness until
thousands of its users developed horrific migraines. They&#8212;Massey and the
lawyers&#8212;believed in the drug and rolled the dice with the first jury trial,
which they fully expected to win in a slam dunk. An overwhelming victory would
dampen the tort bar¡¯s enthusiasm and save Varrick a ton of money. The jury,
though, felt otherwise and gave the plaintiff $20 million.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°This is not
Klervex,¡± Walker said. ¡°Krayoxx is a much better drug, and the lawsuits are
much weaker.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I agree,¡± Massey
said. ¡°I like your plan.¡±</span></p>

CHAPTER_15'><span lang=EN>CHAPTER 15</span></span></h1>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>At least twice a year, and more often if
possible, the Honorable Anderson Zinc and his lovely wife, Caroline, drove from
their home in St. Paul to Chicago to see their only son and his lovely wife,
Helen. Judge Zinc was the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, a
position he had been honored to hold for fourteen years. Caroline Zinc taught
art and photography at a private school in St. Paul. Their two younger
daughters were still in college.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Zinc¡¯s
father, and David¡¯s grandfather, was a legend named Woodrow Zinc, who at the
age of eighty-two was still hard at work managing the two-hundred-lawyer firm
he¡¯d founded fifty years earlier in Kansas City. The Zincs had deep roots in
that city, but not deep enough to keep Anderson Zinc and his son from fleeing
the harshness of working for old Woodrow. They wanted no part of his firm and
left Kansas City, and this had caused a rift that was just beginning to mend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Another rift was
brewing. Judge Zinc did not understand his son¡¯s sudden career change and
wanted to get to the bottom of it. He and Caroline arrived in time for a late
lunch on Saturday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised to see their son at
home. He was usually at the office, downtown in a tall building. On a visit the
previous year, they had never actually laid eyes on him. He came home after
midnight on a Saturday, then left to return to the office five hours later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Today, though, he
was on a ladder cleaning the gutters. He jumped <a name=page119></a>down and
hurried to greet them. ¡°You look great, Mom,¡± he said as he lifted her up and
spun her around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Put me down,¡± she
said. David shook hands with his father, but there was no hug. The Zinc men did
not hug each other. Helen appeared from the garage and greeted her in-laws. She
and David were both grinning goofily about something. He finally said, ¡°We have
some big news.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m pregnant!¡±
Helen blurted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You two geezers
are about to be grandparents,¡± David said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge and Mrs. Zinc
took the news well. They were, after all, in their late fifties and many of
their friends were already grandparents. Helen was thirty-three, two years
older than David, and, well, it was certainly about time, wasn¡¯t it? They
digested this amazing news, rallied nicely, then offered congratulations and
wanted details. Helen gabbed away as David unloaded their luggage and everyone
moved inside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Over lunch, the
baby talk eventually subsided, and Judge Zinc finally got down to business.
¡°Tell me about your new firm, David,¡± he said. David knew damn well his father
had dug and dug and found what little there was to know about Finley &amp;
Figg.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh, Andy, don¡¯t start
that,¡± Caroline said, as if ¡°that¡± were a raw subject that should be avoided.
Caroline agreed with her husband and believed David had made a serious mistake,
but the news of Helen¡¯s pregnancy had changed everything, for the future
grandmother anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I told you on the
phone,¡± David said quickly, anxious to have this discussion and get it over
with. He was also prepared to defend himself, to fight if necessary. His father
chose a career that was not what old Woodrow wanted. David had now done the
same.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s a small
two-man firm with a general practice. Fifty hours a week, which gives me time
to fool around with my wife and keep the family name going. You should be
proud.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m delighted
Helen is expecting, but I¡¯m not sure I understand <a name=page120></a>your
decision. Rogan Rothberg is one of the most prestigious law firms in the world.
They¡¯ve trained judges, legal scholars, diplomats, and leaders of business and
government. How can you just walk away from that?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I didn¡¯t walk
away, Dad, I ran. And I¡¯m not going back. I hate the memories of Rogan
Rothberg, and I think even less of the people.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They were eating as
they spoke. Things were cordial. Andy had promised Caroline he would not
provoke a fight. David had promised Helen he would not engage in one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So, this new firm
has two partners?¡± the judge asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Two partners and
now three lawyers. Plus Rochelle, the secretary, receptionist, office manager,
and a lot of other things.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Support staff?
Clerks, paralegals, interns?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Rochelle handles
all that. It¡¯s a small firm where we do most of our own typing and research.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He¡¯s actually home
for dinner,¡± Helen added. ¡°I¡¯ve never seen him so happy.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You look great,¡±
Caroline said. ¡°Both of you.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The judge was not
accustomed to being outnumbered or outflanked. ¡°These two partners, are they
trial lawyers?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°They claim to be,

not bore you with.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh, it¡¯s not
boring,¡± Helen said, barely suppressing laughter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What kind of money
do they make?¡± the judge asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ve been there
three weeks. They have not shown me the books, but they¡¯re not getting rich.
And I¡¯m sure you wanna know how much I¡¯m making. Same answer. I don¡¯t know. I

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And you¡¯re
starting a family?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, and I¡¯ll be
home for dinner with my family, and T-ball, and <a name=page121></a>Cub Scouts

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I was there,
David, I missed very little.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, you were, but
you never worked for a sweatshop like Rogan Rothberg.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A pause as everybody
took a breath. David said, ¡°We saved a lot. We¡¯ll survive nicely, just wait and

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m sure you

against her husband.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I haven¡¯t started
the nursery yet,¡± Helen said to Caroline. ¡°If you¡¯d like, we can go to a great

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Perfect.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The judge touched
the corners of his mouth with a napkin and said, ¡°Associate boot camp is just
part of the routine these days, David. You survive that, make partner, and life
is good.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I didn¡¯t sign up
for the Marines, Dad, and life is never good at a huge law firm like Rogan
because the partners never make enough money. I know these partners. I¡¯ve seen
them. For the most part, they¡¯re great lawyers and miserable people. I¡¯ve quit.
I¡¯m not going back. Drop it.¡± It was the first flash of anger during lunch, and
David was disappointed in himself. He drank some mineral water and took a bite
of chicken salad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>His father smiled,
took a bite himself, and chewed for a long time. Helen asked about David¡¯s two
sisters, and Caroline jumped at the chance to change the subject.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Over dessert, his
father asked pleasantly, ¡°What type of work are you doing?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Lots of good
stuff. This week I prepared a will for a lady who¡¯s hiding her assets from her
children. They suspect she inherited some money from her third husband, which
she did, but they can¡¯t seem to find it. She wants to leave everything to her
FedEx deliveryman. I represent a gay couple who are trying to adopt a child in
Korea. I have <a name=page122></a>two deportation cases involving illegal
Mexicans who were caught in a drug ring. I represent the family of a
fourteen-year-old girl who¡¯s been hooked on crack for two years and there¡¯s no
place to lock her up for rehab. A couple of drunk-driving clients.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sounds like a
bunch of riffraff,¡± the judge observed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, actually,
they¡¯re real people with real problems who need help. That¡¯s the beauty of
street law&#8212;you meet the clients face-to-face, you get to know them, and, if
things work out, you get to help them.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°If you don¡¯t
starve.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m not going to

then.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I know, I know. I
saw them when I was practicing, and I see their cases now on appeal. Last week,
we affirmed a $9 million jury verdict, a terrible case involving a
brain-damaged kid who got lead poisoning from some toys. His lawyer was a sole
practitioner who did a DUI for the mother. He got the case, called in a
gunslinger to try it, now they¡¯re splitting 40 percent of $9 million.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Those numbers
bounced around the table for a few minutes. ¡°Coffee, anyone?¡± Helen asked. They
all declined and moved to the den. After a few moments, Helen and Caroline left
to inspect the guest room that was about to become a nursery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When they were out
of range, the judge mounted his final assault. ¡°One of my law clerks came

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Let¡¯s just say
that Wally¡¯s complicated.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m not sure your
career will be advanced if you hang around with these guys.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You could be
right, Dad, but for now I¡¯m having fun. I look forward to getting to the

to be out of the sweatshop. Just relax a bit, okay? If this doesn¡¯t work out,
I¡¯ll try something else.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page123></a><span
lang=EN>¡°How did you get involved in this Krayoxx litigation?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We found some
cases.¡± David smiled at the thought of his father¡¯s reaction if he told the
truth about their search for clients. Wally and his .44 Magnum. Wally offering
cash bribes for client referrals. Wally hitting the funeral home circuit. No,
there were things the judge should never know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Have you
researched Krayoxx?¡± the judge asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m in the
process. Have you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, as a matter
of fact. The TV ads are running in Minnesota. The drug is getting a lot of
attention. Looks like another mass tort scam to me. Pile on the lawsuits until
the drugmaker is facing bankruptcy, then broker a huge settlement that makes
the lawyers richer and allows the manufacturer to stay in business. Lost in the
shuffle is the issue of liability, not to mention what¡¯s best for the clients.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s a pretty
fair summary,¡± David admitted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So you¡¯re not sold
on the case?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not yet. I¡¯ve
plowed through a thousand pages, and I¡¯m still looking for the smoking gun, the
research to prove that the drug hurts people. I¡¯m not sure it does.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Then why did you
put your name on the lawsuit?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David took a deep
breath and thought for a moment. ¡°Wally asked me, and since I¡¯m new at the
firm, I felt an obligation to join the fun. Look, Dad, there are some very
powerful lawyers around the country who have filed this same lawsuit and who
believe this is a bad drug. Wally does not inspire a lot of confidence, but
other lawyers do.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So you¡¯re just

of a bed linen sale at a nearby discount house when the call came. A Mr. Jerry
Alisandros from Fort Lauderdale wanted to speak with Mr. Wally Figg, who was at
his desk. She routed the call through and returned to her online work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Moments later,
Wally strutted out of his office with his patented look of self-satisfaction.
¡°Ms. Gibson, could you check flights to Las Vegas this weekend, leaving midday

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I suppose. Who¡¯s
going to Las Vegas?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, who else has
asked about going to Vegas? Me, that¡¯s who. There¡¯s an unofficial meeting of
Krayoxx lawyers this weekend at the MGM Grand. That was Jerry Alisandros on the

there. Is Oscar in?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes. I think he¡¯s

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally tapped on the

said as he pulled himself away from the paperwork littering his desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally fell into a
large leather chair. ¡°Just got a call from Zell &amp; Potter in Fort

off the record. All the big boys will be there to plan the attack. It¡¯s
crucial. They¡¯ll discuss multi-district litigation, which lawsuit goes first,
and, most important, settlement. Jerry thinks <a name=page126></a>that Varrick
might want a quick endgame on this one.¡± Wally was rubbing his hands together
as he spoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Jerry?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Alisandros, the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So you want to go
to Las Vegas?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally shrugged as
if he could take it or leave it. ¡°I don¡¯t care anything about going, Oscar, but
it¡¯s imperative that someone from our firm show up at the table. They might
start talking money, settlement, big bucks, Oscar. This thing could be closer
than we realize.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And you want the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure. It¡¯s a
legitimate litigation expense.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar ruffled
through a pile of papers and found what he wanted. He lifted it and sort of
waved it at his junior partner. ¡°Have you seen David¡¯s memo? It came in last
night. The one about the projected costs of our Krayoxx litigation.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, I didn¡¯t know
he was&#8212;¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The guy¡¯s very
bright, Wally. He¡¯s doing the homework that you should be doing. You need to
take a look at this because it¡¯s scary as hell. We need at least three experts
on board now, not next week. In fact, we should¡¯ve had them lined up before you
filed suit. The first expert is a cardiologist who can explain the cause of
death of each of our beloved clients. Estimated cost to hire one is $20,000,
and that¡¯s just for the initial evaluation and deposition. If the cardiologist
testifies at trial, add another $20,000.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s not going to
trial.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s what you
keep saying. Number two is a pharmacologist who can explain to the jury in
great detail exactly how the drug killed our clients. What did it do to their
hearts? This guy is even pricier&#8212;$25,000 initially and the same if he testifies
at trial.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That sounds high.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°All of it sounds
high. Number three is a research scientist who can present to the jury the
findings of his study that will show, by a preponderance <a name=page127></a>of
the evidence, that statistics prove you¡¯re much likelier to suffer heart damage
while taking Krayoxx than some other cholesterol drug.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I know just the
guy.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Is it McFadden?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s him.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Great. He wrote
the report that started this frenzy, and now he¡¯s a bit reluctant to get
involved in the litigation. However, if a law firm will fork over an initial
retainer of $50,000, he might favor the law firm with a lending hand.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s
outrageous.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s all
outrageous. Please look at David¡¯s memo, Wally. He summarizes the backlash
against McFadden and his work. There are some serious doubts about whether this
drug actually causes harm.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What does David

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What do we know
about litigation, Wally? You¡¯re talking to me, your longtime partner, not some
prospective client. We bark and growl about hauling bad guys into the
courtroom, but you know the truth. We always settle.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And we¡¯re going to

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle
found a much cheaper room at the Spirit of Rio Motel. The photos on its Web
site were of stunning views of the Vegas Strip, and it was easy to get the
impression that its guests were in the thick of things. They were not, as Wally
realized when the airport shuttle van finally stopped. The tall, sleek
casino-hotels were visible, but fifteen <a name=page128></a>minutes away. Wally
cursed Rochelle as he waited in the sauna-like lobby to check in. A standard
room at the MGM Grand was $400 a night. At this dump it was $125, a two-night
savings that almost covered his airfare. Pinching pennies while waiting on a
fortune, Wally told himself as he climbed two flights of stairs to his rather
small room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He couldn¡¯t rent a
car because of his DUI conviction and lack of a valid license. He asked around
and learned that another shuttle ran from the Spirit of Rio to the Strip every
thirty minutes. He played dollar slots in the lobby and won $100. Maybe this
was his lucky weekend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The shuttle was
packed with overweight retirees. Wally couldn¡¯t find a seat, so he stood,
clutched the handrails, rocked along in bodily contact with sweaty people, and,
as he glanced around, he wondered how many might be Krayoxx victims. High
cholesterol was definitely on display. He had business cards in his pockets, as
always, but he let it pass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He roamed the
casino for a while, watching closely as an astonishing variety of people played
blackjack, roulette, and craps, games he¡¯d never played and had no desire to
try now. He killed some time at a slot machine and twice said no thanks to a
comely cocktail waitress. Wally was beginning to realize that a casino was a
lousy place for a recovering drunk. At 7:00 p.m., he found his way to a banquet
room on the mezzanine. Two security guards blocked the door, and Wally was
relieved when they found his name on the list. Inside, there were two dozen or
so well-dressed men, and three women, engaged in light chatter over drinks. A
buffet dinner was being arranged along a far wall. Some of the lawyers knew
each other, but Wally was not the only rookie in the crowd. They all seemed to
recognize his name, and they all knew about his lawsuit. Before long, he was
beginning to fit in. Jerry Alisandros sought him out, and they shook hands like
old friends. Others crowded around, then little pockets of conversation peeled
off here and there. They talked about lawsuits, politics, the latest in private
jets, homes in the Caribbean, and who was getting divorced and remarried. Wally
had little to add, but he gamely hung on and proved <a name=page129></a>to be a
good listener. Trial lawyers prefer to do all the talking, and at times they
all talked at once. Wally was happy to just grin, listen, and sip his club
soda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After a quick
dinner, Alisandros stood and began the conversation. The plan was to meet at
nine the following morning, in the same room, and get down to business. They
should be finished by noon. He had spoken several times with Nicholas Walker at
Varrick, and obviously the company was shell-shocked. In its long and colorful
history of litigation, it had never been hit so fast and so hard with so many
lawsuits. It was scrambling to get some sense of the damage. According to
experts hired by Alisandros, the potential pool of injured or dead could be as
high as half a million.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>This news&#8212;of so
much misery and suffering&#8212;was well received around the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The potential cost
to Varrick, according to yet another expert hired by Alisandros, was at least
$5 billion. Wally was fairly certain he was not the only one at the table who
did a quick multiplication: 40 percent of $5 billion. The others, though,
seemed to take it all in stride. Another drug, another war with Big Pharma,
another massive settlement that would make them even richer. They could buy
more jets, more homes, more trophy wives, assets Wally cared nothing for. All
he wanted was a chunk in the bank, enough cash to make life enjoyable and free
from the daily grind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In a roomful of
considerable egos, it was only a matter of time before someone else wanted the
floor. Dudley Brill, from Lubbock, boots and all, plunged into the retelling of
a recent conversation with a high-ranking Varrick defense lawyer in Houston,
who strongly implied that the company had no plans to settle until after the
drug¡¯s liability was tested before a few juries. Therefore, based on Brill¡¯s
analysis of a conversation no one else in the room knew about, he was of the
firm opinion that he, Dudley Brill of Lubbock, Texas, should lead the first
trial, and do so in his hometown, where the jurors had proven they loved him
and would fork over huge sums if he asked for them. Brill <a name=page130></a>had
obviously been drinking, as had everybody else but Wally, and his self-serving
analysis touched off a furious debate around the dinner table. Before long,
several skirmishes were under way, with tempers flaring and insults being
traded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Jerry Alisandros
managed to bring order. ¡°I was hoping we could save all of this for tomorrow,¡±
he said diplomatically. ¡°Let¡¯s retire now, go to our separate corners, and come
back tomorrow all sobered up and rested.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>From
the looks of things the following morning, not all of the trial lawyers went to
their rooms and to bed. Puffy eyes, red eyes, hands grabbing cold water and
coffee&#8212;the signs were there. There was no shortage of hangovers. There were not
as many lawyers either, and as the morning dragged on, Wally began to realize a
lot of business had been conducted over drinks late the night before. Deals had
been cut, alliances forged, backs stabbed. Wally wondered where he stood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Two experts talked
about Krayoxx and the most recent studies. Each lawyer spent a few minutes
talking about his or her lawsuit&#8212;number of clients, number of potential client
deaths versus injuries, judges, opposing counsel, and verdict trends in the
jurisdiction. Wally winged it nicely and said as little as possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>An incredibly boring
expert dissected the financial health of Varrick Labs and deemed the company
fit enough to sustain huge losses from a Krayoxx settlement. The word
¡°settlement¡± was used frequently and was always ringing in Wally¡¯s ears. The
same expert became even more tedious when analyzing the various insurance
coverages Varrick had in force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After two hours,
Wally needed a break. He eased out and went to find a restroom. When he
returned, Jerry Alisandros was waiting outside the door. ¡°When are you headed
back to Chicago?¡± he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°In the morning,¡±
Wally replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Flying
commercial?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Of course, Wally
thought. I do not have my own jet, so like most <a name=page131></a>poor
Americans I¡¯m forced to pay for a ticket on a jet owned by someone else.
¡°Sure,¡± he said with a smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Look, Wally, I¡¯m
headed to New York this afternoon. Why don¡¯t you hitch a ride? My firm just
bought a brand-new Gulfstream G650. We¡¯ll have lunch on the plane and drop you
off in Chicago.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There would be a
price to pay, a deal to be cut, but Wally was looking for one anyway. He had
read about rich trial lawyers and their private jets, but it had never crossed
his mind that he would see the inside of one. ¡°That¡¯s very generous,¡± he said.
¡°Sure.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Meet me in the
lobby at 1:00 p.m., okay?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You got it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There
were a dozen or so private jets lined up on the deck at McCarran Field¡¯s
general aviation center. As Wally followed his new pal Jerry past them, he
wondered how many were owned by the other mass tort boys. When they got to
Jerry¡¯s, he climbed the steps, took a breath, then stepped inside the gleaming
G650. A striking Asian girl took his coat and asked what he wanted to drink.
Just club soda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Jerry Alisandros
had a small entourage with him&#8212;an associate, two paralegals, and an assistant
of some kind. They huddled briefly in the rear of the cabin as Wally settled
into the rich leather seat and thought about Iris Klopeck and Millie Marino,
and those wonderful widows whose dead husbands had led Wally into the world of
mass torts, and now to this. The flight attendant handed Wally a menu. Down the
aisle, far away, he could see a kitchen with a chef, just waiting. As they
taxied, Jerry made his way to the front and sat down opposite Wally. ¡°What do
you think?¡± he asked, raising his hands to take in his latest toy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure beats
commercial,¡± Wally said. Jerry howled with laughter&#8212;no doubt the funniest thing
he¡¯d ever heard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A voice announced
takeoff, and they all buckled their seat belts. As the jet left the runway and
shot upward, Wally closed his eyes and tried to savor the moment. It might
never happen again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page132></a><span
lang=EN>As soon as they began to level off, Jerry came to life. He popped a
switch and pulled a mahogany table out of the wall. ¡°Let¡¯s talk business,¡± he
said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It¡¯s your plane,
Wally thought. ¡°Sure.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How many cases do
you realistically expect to sign up?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We might get ten
death cases; we have eight now. Non-death, I¡¯m not sure. We have a pool of
several hundred potential cases, but we haven¡¯t screened them yet.¡± Jerry
frowned as if this weren¡¯t enough, not worth his time. Wally wondered if he
might order the pilot to turn around or open a hatch somewhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Have you thought
about teaming up with a bigger firm?¡± Jerry asked. ¡°I know you guys don¡¯t do a
lot of mass tort work.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure, I¡¯m open to
that discussion,¡± Wally replied, trying to conceal his excitement. That had
been his plan since the beginning. ¡°My contracts provide for a contingency fee
of 40 percent. How much do you want?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°In our typical
deal, we front the expenses, and these are not cheap cases. We find the
doctors, experts, researchers, whomever, and they cost a fortune. We take half
the fee, 20 percent, but the expenses are paid back to us before any split of
the fee.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That sounds fair.
What¡¯s our role in this?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Simple. Find more
cases, death and non-death. Round ¡¯em up. I¡¯ll send a draft of an agreement on
Monday. I¡¯m trying to piece together as many cases as possible. The next big
step is the creation of an MDL&#8212;multi-district litigation. The court will
appoint a plaintiff¡¯s trial committee, usually five or six seasoned lawyers who
will control the litigation. That panel is entitled to an additional fee,
usually around 6 percent, and this comes off the top and out of the lawyers¡¯
portion.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was nodding
along. He¡¯d done some research and knew the ins and outs, most of them. ¡°Will
you be on the trial committee?¡± he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Probably, I
usually am.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The flight
attendant brought fresh drinks. Jerry took a sip of wine and continued. ¡°When
discovery starts, we¡¯ll send someone to help <a name=page133></a>with the
depositions of your clients. No big deal. Pretty routine legal work. Keep in
mind, Wally, that the defense firms see this as a gold mine too, so they work
the cases hard. I¡¯ll find a cardiologist we can trust, one who¡¯ll screen your
clients for damage. We¡¯ll pay him out of the litigation fund. Any questions?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not now,¡± Wally
said. He was not pleased to be giving away half the fee, but he was delighted
to be in business with an experienced and deep-pocketed tort firm. There would
still be plenty of money for Finley &amp; Figg. He thought of Oscar and
couldn¡¯t wait to tell him about the G650.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What¡¯s your best
guess for the timeline?¡± Wally asked. In other words, when can I expect some
money?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A long, satisfying
pull of the wine, and, ¡°Based on my experience, which, as you know, Wally, is
quite vast, I expect we¡¯ll reach a settlement in twelve months and start
disbursing money right away. Who knows, Wally, in a year or so you might have
your own airplane.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Nicholas Walker flew with Judy Beck and two other
Varrick lawyers to Chicago on one of the company¡¯s corporate jets, a Gulfstream
G650 that was just as new as the one that had so thoroughly impressed Wally.
The purpose of their trip was to fire their old law firm and hire a new one.
Walker and his boss, Reuben Massey, had hammered out the details of a master
plan to deal with their Krayoxx mess, and the first major battle would take
place in Chicago. First, though, they had to get the right people in place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The wrong people
belonged to a firm that had represented Varrick Labs for a decade, and their
work had always been considered top-notch. Their shortcoming was not their
fault. According to the exhaustive research done by Walker and his team, there
was another firm in the city with closer ties to Judge Harry Seawright. And this
firm happened to have a partner who was the hottest defense lawyer in town.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Her name was Nadine
Karros, a forty-four-year-old litigation partner who had not lost a jury trial
in ten years. The more she won, the more difficult her cases became, and the
more impressive her victories. After chatting with dozens of attorneys who had
faced her in court, and lost, Nick Walker and Reuben Massey decided that Ms.
Karros would lead the defense of Krayoxx. And they didn¡¯t care what it would
eventually cost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>First, though, they
had to convince her. During a long teleconference, <a name=page135></a>she had
seemed ambivalent about taking charge of a major case that was expanding daily.
Not surprisingly, she already had too much work on her desk; her trial calendar
was booked; and so on. She had never been involved in a mass tort case, though
as a pure litigator this was not much of an obstacle. Walker and Massey knew
her recent string of courtroom wins included a wide range of issues&#8212;groundwater
contamination, hospital negligence, the midair collision of two commuter
planes. As an elite courtroom advocate, Nadine Karros could handle any case
before any jury.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She was a partner
in the litigation section of Rogan Rothberg, on the eighty-fifth floor of the
Trust Tower, with a corner office with a view of the lake, though she seldom
enjoyed it. She met the Varrick crew in a large conference room on the
eighty-sixth floor, and after everyone had a quick gawk at Lake Michigan, they
settled in for what was expected to be a two-hour meeting, minimum. On her side
of the table, Ms. Karros had the usual complement of young associates and
paralegals, a veritable entourage of grim-faced minions ready to say ¡°How
high?¡± when she said ¡°Jump!¡± To her right was a male litigation partner named
Hotchkin, her right-hand man.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Later,
in a phone call to Reuben Massey, Nicholas Walker would report, ¡°She¡¯s very
attractive, Reuben, long dark hair, strong chin and teeth, beautiful hazel eyes
that are so warm and inviting you think this is the woman I want to take home to
meet Momma. A very pleasant personality, quick with a nice smile. A deep, rich
voice like one you¡¯d expect from an opera singer. Easy to see why jurors are so
taken with her. But she¡¯s tough, no doubt about that, Reuben. She takes charge
and gives orders, and you get the impression that those around her are fiercely
loyal. I¡¯d hate to face this woman in court, Reuben.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So, she¡¯s the
one?¡± Reuben asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No question. I
found myself looking forward to the trial, just to watch her in action.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Legs?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page136></a><span
lang=EN>¡°Oh yes. The package. Slender, dressed like something out of a
magazine. You should meet her as soon as possible.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It
was her turf, so Ms. Karros quickly assumed control of the meeting. She nodded
to Hotchkin and said, ¡°Mr. Hotchkin and I presented your proposal to our Fee
Committee. My rate will be $1,000 an hour out of court, $2,000 in court, with
an initial retainer of $5 million, nonrefundable of course.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nicholas Walker had
been negotiating fees with elite lawyers for two decades, and he was
shockproof. ¡°And how much for the other partners?¡± he asked calmly, as if his
company could handle anything she threw at them, which in fact it could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Eight hundred an
hour. Five hundred for associates,¡± she replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Agreed,¡± he said.
Everyone in the room knew the cost of defense would run into the millions. In
fact, Walker and his team had already pegged their initial estimate at $25 to
30 million. Peanuts, when you¡¯re getting sued for billions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With the air clear
on what it would cost, they moved on to the next important matter. Nicholas
Walker had the floor. ¡°Our strategy is simple and it¡¯s complicated,¡± he began.
¡°Simple, in that we pick a case from the myriad of those filed against us, an
individual case, not a class action, and we push hard for a trial. We want a trial.
We are not afraid of a trial, because we believe in our drug. We believe, and
we can prove, that the research being relied upon by the tort boys is deeply
flawed. We are convinced that Krayoxx does what it is supposed to do, and it
does not increase the risks of heart attack or stroke. We are certain of this,
so certain that we want a jury, one right here in Chicago, to hear our
evidence, and soon. We are confident the jury will believe us, and when the
jury rejects the attack on Krayoxx, when the jury finds in our favor, the
battlefield will change dramatically. Frankly, we think the tort bar will
scatter like leaves in the wind. They¡¯ll cave. It might take another trial,
another victory, but I doubt it. In short, Ms. <a name=page137></a>Karros, we
hit them hard and fast with a jury trial, and when we win, they¡¯ll go home.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She listened
without taking notes. When he finished, she said, ¡°Indeed, that¡¯s pretty
simple, and not altogether original. Why Chicago?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The judge. Harry
Seawright. We¡¯ve researched every judge in every Krayoxx case filed so far, and
we think Seawright is our man. He¡¯s shown little patience for mass torts. He
despises frivolous lawsuits and junk filings. He uses his Rocket Docket to ram
cases through discovery and get them to trial. He refuses to allow cases to
gather dust. His favorite nephew uses Krayoxx. And, most important, his close
friend is former U.S. senator Paxson, who now has an office on, I believe, the
eighty-third floor here at Rogan Rothberg.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Are you suggesting
we could somehow influence a federal judge?¡± she asked, with her left eyebrow
slightly arched.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Of course not,¡±
Walker said with a nasty grin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What¡¯s the
complicated part of your plan?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Deception. We
create the impression that we intend to settle the Krayoxx cases. We¡¯ve been
down this road before, believe me, so we know quite a lot about mass
settlements. We understand the greed of the tort bar, and it is enormous beyond
imagination. Once they believe that billions are about to hit the table, the
frenzy will get much worse. With a settlement looming, the preparation for a
major trial will become less important. Why bother to prepare when the cases
are about to settle? We&#8212;you&#8212;on the other hand, are working diligently to get
ready for the trial. In our scheme, Judge Seawright will crack the whip, and
the case will move along quickly. At the perfect moment, the settlement
negotiations will collapse, the mass tort bar will be in chaos, and we¡¯ll be
staring at a trial date that Seawright will refuse to move.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine Karros was nodding,
smiling, enjoying the scenario. ¡°I¡¯m sure you have a case in mind,¡± she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh yes. There¡¯s a
local divorce lawyer named Wally Figg who <a name=page138></a>filed the first
Krayoxx case here in Chicago. Not much of a lawyer, three-man firm,
nickel-and-dime stuff down on the Southwest Side. Almost zero trial experience,
and absolutely none in the mass tort arena. Now he¡¯s hooked up with a lawyer in
Fort Lauderdale named Jerry Alisandros, a longtime nemesis whose goal in life
is to sue Varrick at least once a year. Alisandros is a force.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Can he try a
case?¡± Nadine asked, already thinking about the trial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°His firm is Zell
&amp; Potter, and they have some competent trial lawyers, but they rarely go to
trial. Their specialty is forcing companies to settle and raking in enormous
fees. At this point, we have no idea who would show up here and actually handle
the trial. They might bring in a local lawyer.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>To Walker¡¯s left,
Judy Beck cleared her throat and began, somewhat nervously, ¡°Alisandros has
already filed a motion to consolidate every Krayoxx case into an MDL,
multi-district litigation, and&#8212;¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We understand
MDL,¡± Hotchkin broke in sharply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Of course.
Alisandros has a favorite federal judge in southern Florida, and his MO is to
create the MDL, get himself appointed to the plaintiff¡¯s steering committee,
then control the litigation. He, of course, receives extra compensation for
being on the committee.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nick Walker took up
the narrative. ¡°Initially, we would resist all efforts to consolidate the
cases. Our plan is to select one of Mr. Figg¡¯s clients and convince Judge
Seawright to assign it to his Rocket Docket.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What if the judge
in Florida orders consolidation of all cases and wants them down there?¡±
Hotchkin asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Judge Seawright is
a federal judge,¡± Walker said. ¡°The case has been filed in his court. If he
wants to try it here, no one, not even the Supreme Court, can order him to do
otherwise.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine Karros was
scanning a summary that had been passed around by the Varrick team. She said,
¡°So, if I follow things, we select one of Mr. Figg¡¯s dead clients, and we
convince Judge Seawright to extract this case from the group. Then, assuming
the judge goes along, <a name=page139></a>we respond rather softly to the
lawsuit, admit nothing, issue bland denials, take an easy approach to discovery
because we don¡¯t want to slow things down, take a few depositions, give them
whatever documents they want, and sort of lead them down the primrose path
until they wake up and realize they have a real trial on their hands.
Meanwhile, you lull them into a false sense of security with the illusion of
another jackpot.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s it,¡± Nick
Walker said. ¡°Exactly.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They
spent almost an hour discussing Mr. Figg¡¯s dead clients&#8212;Chester Marino, Percy
Klopeck, Wanda Grand, Frank Schmidt, and four others. As soon as the lawsuit
was properly answered, Ms. Karros and her team would depose the legal
representatives of the dead eight. Once they had the opportunity to observe and
learn, they would make the decision about which one to isolate and push toward
a trial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The matter of young
David Zinc was dealt with quickly. Though he had worked at Rogan Rothberg for
five years, he was no longer employed there. No conflict of interest existed
because at the time the firm did not represent Varrick, and Zinc did not
represent the dead clients. Nadine Karros had never met him; indeed, only one
associate on her side of the table could recall ever knowing who he was. Zinc
had worked in international finance, a world away from litigation.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Zinc
was now working in the world of street law and happy to be even further away
from international finance. Very much on his mind these days was the Burmese
housekeeper and her lead-poisoned grandson. He had a name, a phone number, and
an address, but making contact had proved difficult. Toni, Helen¡¯s friend, had
suggested to the grandmother that the family consult a lawyer, but this had
terrified the poor woman to the point of tears. She was emotionally spent,
confused, and, for the moment, unapproachable. Her grandson remained on life
support.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page140></a><span
lang=EN>David had contemplated running the case by his two partners but quickly
thought better of it. Wally might go charging into the hospital room and
frighten someone to death. Oscar might insist on taking charge of the case and
then want an extra percentage in the event of a settlement. As David was
learning, his two partners did not split money equally and, according to
Rochelle, fought over fees. Points were given for the lawyer who made initial
contact, more for the lawyer who worked up the file, and so on. According to
Rochelle, on almost every decent car wreck Oscar and Wally quibbled over the
split.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David was at his
desk drafting a simple will for a new client&#8212;typing it himself because Rochelle
had informed him weeks earlier that three lawyers were far too many for one
secretary&#8212;when his e-mail chimed with a note from the federal court clerk. He
opened the e-mail and found an answer to their amended complaint. His eyes went
straight to the attorney register, straight to the name of Nadine Karros of
Rogan Rothberg, and he felt faint.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David had never met
her, but he certainly knew her by reputation. She was famous throughout the
entire Chicago bar. She tried and won the biggest cases of all. He had never
uttered a recorded word in court. But there they were, names listed together as
if they were equals. For the plaintiffs&#8212;Wallis T. Figg, B. Oscar Finley, David
E. Zinc, of the firm of Finley &amp; Figg, along with S. Jerry Alisandros of
the firm of Zell &amp; Potter. And for Varrick Laboratories, Nadine L. Karros
and R. Luther Hotchkin of the firm of Rogan Rothberg. On paper, David looked as
if he belonged in the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He read the answer
slowly. The obvious facts were admitted; all liability was denied. Overall, it
was a straightforward, almost benign response to a $100 million lawsuit, and it
was not what they had anticipated. According to Wally, the first response from
Varrick would be a vicious motion to dismiss, accompanied by a weighty brief
prepared by bright Ivy Leaguers who toiled in the firm¡¯s research department.
The motion to dismiss would cause a significant skirmish, but they would
prevail because such motions were rarely granted, according to Wally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Along with the
answer, the defense filed a set of basic interrogatories <a name=page141></a>that
sought personal information about each of the eight dead clients and their
families, and requested the names and general testimonies of the expert
witnesses. As far as David knew, they had yet to hire experts, though Jerry
Alisandros was believed to be in charge of that. Ms. Karros also wanted to take
the eight depositions as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>According to the
clerk, a hard copy of the answer and other filings was in the mail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David heard heavy
footsteps on the stairs. Wally¡¯s. He lumbered in, panting, and said, ¡°You see
what they filed?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Just read it,¡±
David answered. ¡°Seems rather tame, don¡¯t you think?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What do you know
about litigation?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Ouch.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sorry. Something¡¯s
up. I gotta call Alisandros and figure this thing out.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s just a simple
answer and some discovery. Nothing to panic over.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who¡¯s panicked?
You know this woman&#8212;it is your old law firm?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Never met her, but
she¡¯s supposed to be terrific in the courtroom.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yeah, well, so is
Alisandros, but we ain¡¯t going to court.¡± He said this with a noticeable lack
of conviction. He left the office mumbling and stomped down the stairs. A month
had passed since they had filed the lawsuit, and Wally¡¯s dreams of a quick gold
strike were fading. It looked as though they would be required to do a little
work before the settlement talks began.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ten minutes later,
David received an e-mail from the junior partner. It read: ¡°Can you get started
on those interrogatories? I gotta run down to the funeral home.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Sure, Wally. I¡¯d

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>The minor charges against Trip were eventually
dropped due to a lack of interest, though the court did require him to sign a
statement promising to stay away from the firm of Finley &amp; Figg and its
lawyers. Trip vanished, but his ex-girlfriend did not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>DeeAnna arrived
minutes before 5:00 p.m., her usual time. On this day, she was dressed like a
cowgirl&#8212;skintight jeans, boots with pointed toes, a tight red blouse upon which
she had neglected to fasten the top three buttons. ¡°Is Wally in?¡± she cooed at
Rochelle, who couldn¡¯t stand her. The cloud of perfume caught up with her and
settled into the room, causing AC to sniff, then growl and retreat even farther
under the desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He¡¯s in,¡± Rochelle
said dismissively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thanks, dear,¡±
DeeAnna said, trying to irritate Rochelle as much as possible. She strutted to
Wally¡¯s office and entered without knocking. A week earlier, Rochelle had
instructed her to sit and wait like all the other clients. It was becoming
apparent, though, that she had far more clout than the other clients, at least
as far as Wally was concerned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Once inside the
office, DeeAnna walked into the arms of her lawyer, and after a long kiss with

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally checked to
make sure the door was locked, then returned to <a name=page143></a>his swivel
chair behind his desk. ¡°I need to make two calls, then we¡¯re outta here,¡± he
said, drooling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Anything, baby,¡±
she cooed, then she took a seat and pulled out a celebrity gossip magazine. She
read nothing else and was as dumb as a rock, but Wally didn¡¯t care. He refused
to judge her. She¡¯d had four husbands. He¡¯d had four wives. Who was he to pass
judgment? Right now, they were in the process of trying to kill each other in
bed, and Wally had never been happier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Outside, Rochelle
was tidying up her desk, anxious to leave now that ¡°that hooker¡± was in Mr.
Figg¡¯s office and who knew what they were doing in there. Oscar¡¯s door opened,
and he emerged, holding some paperwork. ¡°Where¡¯s Figg?¡± he asked, looking at
Figg¡¯s closed door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°In there with a
client,¡± Rochelle said. ¡°Door¡¯s bolted and locked.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Don¡¯t tell me.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yep. Third day in
a row.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Are they still
negotiating his fee?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Don¡¯t know. He
must¡¯ve raised it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Though the fee was
small&#8212;just a typical no-fault divorce case&#8212;Oscar was due a portion of it, but
he wasn¡¯t sure how to get his split when half was being paid on the sofa. He
stared at Wally¡¯s door for a moment, as if waiting for the sounds of passion,
and, hearing none, turned to Rochelle and waved the papers. ¡°Have you read
this?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What is it?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s our agreement
with Jerry Alisandros and Zell &amp; Potter. Eight pages long, lots of fine
print, already signed by my junior partner, obviously without being read in its
entirety. Says here that we must contribute $25,000 to help front the litigation
expenses. Figg never mentioned this to me.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle shrugged.
It was lawyer business, not hers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But Oscar was hot.
¡°Further, it says that we get a fee of 40 percent on each case, half of which
goes to Zell &amp; Potter. But in the fine print it says that a fee of 6
percent is paid to the Plaintiffs¡¯ Litigation Committee, <a name=page144></a>a
little bonus to the big shots for their hard work, and the 6 percent comes off
the top of the settlement and out of our portion. So, as I figure it, we lose 6
percent off the top, and that gives us 34 percent to split with Alisandros, who
of course will get a chunk of the 6 percent. Does this make sense to you, Ms.
Gibson?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That makes two of
us. We¡¯re getting screwed right and left, and now we must put up $25,000 for
litigation expenses.¡± Oscar¡¯s cheeks were red, and he kept looking at Wally¡¯s
door, but Wally was safe inside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David came down the
steps and walked into the conversation. ¡°Have you read this?¡± Oscar asked
angrily, waving the contract.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What is it?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Our contract with Zell
&amp; Potter.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I looked over it,¡±
David said. ¡°It¡¯s pretty straightforward.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh, it is? Did you
read the part about the $25,000 up-front money for expenses?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, and I asked
Wally about that. He said we¡¯d probably just go to the bank, hit the firm¡¯s line
of credit, then pay it back when we settle.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar looked at
Rochelle, who looked back at Oscar. Both were thinking, What line of credit?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar started to
speak, then abruptly wheeled around and returned to his office, slamming the
door after himself. ¡°What¡¯s that all about?¡± David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We don¡¯t have a
line of credit,¡± Rochelle said. ¡°Mr. Finley¡¯s worried that the Krayoxx
litigation will backfire and kill us financially. This wouldn¡¯t be the first
time one of Figg¡¯s schemes blew up in our faces, but it could certainly be the
biggest.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David glanced
around and took a step closer. ¡°Can I ask you something, in confidence?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t know,¡± she
said, taking a cautious step back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°These guys have
been at this game for a long time. Thirty plus years for Oscar, twenty plus for
Wally. Do they have some money <a name=page145></a>stashed away somewhere? You
don¡¯t see any around the office, so I figured they must have some buried.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle glanced
around too, then said, ¡°I don¡¯t know where the money goes when it leaves here.
I doubt if Oscar has a dime because his wife spends everything. She thinks
she¡¯s a cut or two above and wants to play that game. Wally, who knows? I
suspect he¡¯s as broke as I am. But they do own the building free and clear.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David couldn¡¯t help
but look at the cracks in the ceiling plaster. Let it go, he told himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Just curious,¡±
David said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There was a shriek
of female laughter from deep inside Mr. Figg¡¯s office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m leaving,¡±
David said, grabbing his overcoat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Me too,¡± Rochelle
said.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Everyone
was gone when Wally and DeeAnna emerged. They quickly turned off the lights,
locked the front door, and got in her car. Wally was delighted to have not only
a new squeeze but also one who was willing to drive. He had six weeks left on
his suspension, and with Krayoxx so hot he needed to be mobile. DeeAnna had
jumped at the chance to earn referral fees&#8212;$500 cash for a death case and $200
for a non-death&#8212;but what really thrilled her was listening to Wally¡¯s
predictions of taking down Varrick Labs in a massive settlement that would
bring in huge fees for him (and perhaps something for her as well, though this
wasn¡¯t exactly out in the open yet). More often than not, their pillow talk
drifted away to the world of Krayoxx and all it could mean. Her third husband
had taken her to Maui, and she loved the beach. Wally had already promised a
vacation in paradise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At that stage of
their involvement, Wally would have promised her anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Where to, dear?¡±
she said, racing away from the office. She was a dangerous driver in a little
Mazda convertible, and Wally knew his <a name=page146></a>chances would be slim
in a collision. ¡°Just take it easy,¡± he said, ratcheting down the seat belt.
¡°Let¡¯s go north, toward Evanston.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Are we hearing
from these people?¡± she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh yes. Lots of
phone calls.¡± And Wally wasn¡¯t lying&#8212;his cell phone rang constantly with
inquiries from people who had picked up his little ¡°Beware of Krayoxx!¡±
brochure. He had printed ten thousand and was littering Chicago with them. He
tacked them on bulletin boards in Weight Watchers meeting rooms, VFW posts,
bingo parlors, hospital waiting rooms, and the restrooms of fast-food
restaurants&#8212;anywhere the shrewd mind of Wally Figg thought there might be
people battling high cholesterol.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So how many cases
do we have?¡± she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally did not miss
the ¡°we¡± part of her question. He wasn¡¯t about to tell her the truth. ¡°Eight
death cases, several hundred non-death, but they have to be tested first. I¡¯m
not sure every non-death case is really a case. Gotta find some damage to the
heart before we take on the case.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How do you do
that?¡± They were flying along the Stevenson, dodging traffic, most of which she
didn¡¯t appear to notice. Wally was ducking with each near miss. ¡°Take it easy,
DeeAnna, we¡¯re not in a hurry,¡± he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re always bitching
about my driving,¡± she said as she gave him a long, sad look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Just watch the
road. And slow down.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She eased off the
gas and pouted for a few minutes. ¡°As we were saying, how do you know if these
people have been damaged?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯ll hire a doctor
to screen them. Krayoxx weakens the heart valves, and there are some tests that
can tell us if a client has been harmed by the drug.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How much are the
tests?¡± she asked. Wally was noticing a growing curiosity into the economics of
their Krayoxx litigation, and it was slightly irksome.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°About a thousand
bucks a pop,¡± he said, though he had no idea. Jerry Alisandros had assured him
that Zell &amp; Potter had already retained the services of several doctors who
were screening potential <a name=page147></a>clients. These doctors would be
made available to Finley &amp; Figg in the near future, and once the testing
began, their pool of non-death clients would expand greatly. Alisandros was on
a jet every day zipping across the country, meeting with lawyers like Wally,
piecing together big lawsuits here and there, hiring experts, plotting trial
strategies, and, most important, hammering away at Varrick and its lawyers.
Wally felt honored to be a player in such a high-stakes game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s a lot of
money,¡± DeeAnna said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Why are you so concerned
about the money?¡± Wally snapped, glancing down at her unbuttoned cowgirl shirt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m sorry, Wally.
You know I¡¯m the nosy type. This is all so exciting and stuff, and, well, it¡¯ll
be so awesome when Varrick starts writing those big checks.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That could be a
long way off. Let¡¯s just concentrate on rounding up the clients.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At
the Finley home, Oscar and his wife, Paula, were watching a <span class=0Text>M*A*S*H</span>
rerun on cable when they were suddenly confronted with the shrill voice and
anxious face of a lawyer named Bosch, who was no stranger to cable commercials
in the Chicago market. For years, Bosch had been pleading for car wrecks and
tractor-trailer accident victims and cases involving asbestos and other
products, and now, evidently, Bosch had become an expert on Krayoxx. He
thundered on about the dangers of the drug and said vile things about Varrick
Labs, and throughout the entire thirty seconds his phone number was pulsating
across the bottom of the screen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar watched with
great curiosity but said nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Paula said, ¡°Have
you ever thought about advertising on television, Oscar? Seems like your firm
needs to do something to get more business.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>This was not a new
conversation. For thirty years, Paula had dispensed unsolicited advice on how
to run the law office, a place that would never generate enough in revenue to
satisfy her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page148></a><span
lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s very expensive,¡± Oscar said. ¡°Figg wants to pursue it. I¡¯m
skeptical.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, you
certainly couldn¡¯t put Figg on television, could you? That would scare away
every potential client for a hundred miles. I don¡¯t know, the ads just seem so
unprofessional.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Typical of Paula.
TV advertising might bring in some business, and at the same time it was
unprofessional. Was she for it or against it? Neither, or both? Oscar didn¡¯t
know, and he¡¯d stopped caring years earlier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Doesn¡¯t Figg have
some Krayoxx cases?¡± she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A few, yes,¡± Oscar
grunted. She did not know that Oscar, as well as David, had signed the lawsuit
and was responsible for its prosecution. She did not know that the firm was on
the line for litigation expenses. Paula¡¯s only concern was the paltry monthly
draw brought home by Oscar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, I discussed
it with my doctor, and he says the drug is fine. It keeps my cholesterol under
two hundred. I am not getting off the drug.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Then you should
not,¡± he said. If Krayoxx did in fact kill people, he wanted her to keep taking
the full daily dosage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But there are
lawsuits everywhere, Oscar. I¡¯m still not convinced. Are you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She¡¯s loyal to the
drug, but she¡¯s worried about the drug.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Figg is convinced
the drug causes damages,¡± Oscar said. ¡°A lot of big law firms agree, and
they¡¯re going after Varrick. The general feeling is that the company will
settle before going to trial. Too much at risk.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So, if there¡¯s a
settlement, what happens to Figg¡¯s cases?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°They¡¯re all death
cases, so far. Eight of them. If they settle, then we¡¯ll collect some nice
fees.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How nice?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s impossible to
say.¡± Oscar was already making plans. If and when the settlement talk became
serious, he would move out, file for divorce, then try to keep her away from
his Krayoxx money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But I doubt
they¡¯ll settle,¡± he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page149></a><span
lang=EN>¡°Why not? Bosch here says there might be a big settlement.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Bosch is an idiot,
and he proves it every day. These big pharmaceuticals usually go to trial a few
times to test the waters. If they get hammered by juries, then they start
settling. If they win, they keep trying the cases until the plaintiffs¡¯ lawyers
give up. This could take years.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Don¡¯t get your

working shorter hours and their newfound energy, it had taken less than a week

CHAPTER_19'><span lang=EN>CHAPTER 19</span></span></h1>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>The official name of the gathering was a
discovery conference, and it was typically a brief lawyers¡¯ get-together in
front of the judge to discuss the initial stages of the lawsuit. No record was
kept, just informal notes taken by a clerk. Often, and especially in the
courtroom of Harry Seawright, the judge himself begged off and sent a
magistrate to pinch-hit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Today, however,
Judge Seawright was presiding. As the senior judge in the Northern District of
Illinois he had a large courtroom, a splendid and spacious layout on the
twenty-third floor of the Dirksen Federal Building on Dearborn Street in
downtown Chicago. The courtroom was lined with dark, oak-paneled walls, and
there were plenty of thick leather chairs for the various players. On the right
side, and to the judge¡¯s left, was the plaintiffs¡¯ team of Wally Figg and David
Zinc. On the left side, and to the judge¡¯s right, was the team of about a dozen
or so Rogan Rothberg lawyers toiling away on behalf of Varrick Laboratories.
Their leader, of course, was Nadine Karros, the only female lawyer present, and
for the occasion she was modeling a classic Armani navy suit, skirt just above
the knees, nude legs, and designer platform pumps with four-inch heels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally couldn¡¯t take
his eyes off the shoes, the skirt, the entire package. ¡°Maybe we should come to
federal court more often,¡± he¡¯d quipped to David, who was in no mood for humor.
Nor was Wally, to be honest. For both of them, it was their first venture into
a federal <a name=page152></a>courtroom. Wally claimed he handled cases in
federal court all the time, but David was doubtful. Oscar, senior partner, who
was supposed to be there with them, taking on the twin Goliaths of Rogan
Rothberg and Varrick, had called in sick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar wasn¡¯t the
only no-show. The great Jerry Alisandros and his team of world-class litigators
were all lined up to blast into Chicago for an impressive display of strength,
but a last-minute emergency hearing in Boston had become more important. Wally
freaked out when he got the call from one of Alisandros¡¯s underlings. ¡°It¡¯s
just a discovery conference,¡± the young man said. Driving to court, Wally had
expressed skepticism about Zell &amp; Potter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For David, the
moment was extremely uncomfortable. He was sitting in a federal courtroom for
the first time knowing that he would not say a word because he had no idea what
to say, and his opposition was a team of well-dressed and highly skilled
lawyers from a firm he¡¯d once been loyal to, a firm that had recruited him,
trained him, paid him a top salary, and promised him a long career, and a firm
that he had jilted, rejected. In favor of ¡¦ Finley &amp; Figg? He could almost
hear them snickering behind their legal pads. David, with his pedigree and
Harvard diploma, belonged over there, where they billed by the hour, not on the
plaintiffs¡¯ side, where you beat the streets looking for clients. David did not
want to be where he was. Nor did Wally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright
settled himself into his perch and wasted no time. ¡°Where¡¯s Mr. Alisandros?¡± he
growled in the direction of Wally and David.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally jumped to his
feet, offered a greasy smile, and said, ¡°He¡¯s in Boston, sir.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So he will not be
here today?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s right, Your
Honor. He was on his way but got sidetracked with some emergency in Boston.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I see. He¡¯s an
attorney of record for the plaintiffs in this case. The next time we get together,
tell him to be here. I will fine him $1,000 for missing the conference.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes sir.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page153></a><span
lang=EN>¡°And you¡¯re Mr. Figg?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s correct,
Your Honor, and this is my associate, David Zinc.¡± David tried to smile. He
could almost see every Rogan Rothberg lawyer craning to have a look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Welcome to federal
court,¡± the judge said sarcastically. He looked at the defense and said, ¡°I
suppose you¡¯re Ms. Karros?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She stood, and
every eye in the courtroom locked onto her. ¡°I am, Your Honor, and this is my
co-counsel, Luther Hotchkin.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who are all of
those other people?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°This is our
defense team, Your Honor.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Do you really need
all these people for a simple discovery conference?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Give ¡¯em hell,
Wally thought, still staring at the skirt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We do indeed, Your
Honor. This is a large and complicated case.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So I¡¯ve heard. You
may keep your seats for the remainder of this hearing.¡± Judge Seawright picked
up some notes and adjusted his reading glasses. ¡°Now, I¡¯ve spoken to two of my
colleagues in Florida, and we are not sure if these cases will proceed in a
multi-district litigation. It appears as if the plaintiffs¡¯ lawyers are having
some difficulty getting themselves organized. Many, it seems, want a bigger
piece of the pie, which is not surprising. At any rate, we have no choice but
to proceed with discovery in this case. Mr. Figg, who are your experts?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Mr. Figg had no
experts and had no idea when he might retain them. He was relying on the
increasingly unreliable Jerry Alisandros to find the experts because that¡¯s
what he promised to do. Wally stood slowly, knowing that any hesitation would
look bad. ¡°We¡¯ll have them next week, Your Honor. As you know, we are
partnering with the law firm of Zell &amp; Potter, a well-known firm
specializing in mass torts, and with the flurry of activity around the country
it¡¯s been difficult to lock up the best experts. But we¡¯re definitely making
progress.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s nice.
Please sit down. So you actually filed this lawsuit before you consulted with
any experts?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, yes, Your
Honor, and that¡¯s not unusual.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright
doubted if Mr. Figg knew what was usual or <a name=page154></a>unusual, but he
decided not to embarrass the guy this early in the game. He picked up a pen and
said, ¡°You have ten days to designate your experts, then the defense will be
allowed to depose them without delay.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes sir,¡± Wally
said, falling back into his chair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thank you. Now, we
have eight death cases here, so we¡¯re dealing with eight families. To start
with, I want you to take the depositions of the personal representatives of all
eight. Mr. Figg, when can you make these people available?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Tomorrow,¡± Wally
said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The judge turned to
Nadine Karros and said, ¡°That soon enough?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She smiled and
said, ¡°We prefer reasonable notice, Your Honor.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m sure you have
a busy trial calendar, Ms. Karros.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°As always, yes.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And you also have
unlimited resources. I count eleven lawyers taking notes right now, and I¡¯m
sure there are hundreds more back at the firm. These are just depositions,
nothing complicated, so on Wednesday of next week you¡¯re going to depose four
of the plaintiffs, and on Thursday you¡¯ll do the other four. Two hours max per
plaintiff; if you need more time, we¡¯ll do them later. If you can¡¯t be there,
Ms. Karros, just pick out five or six from your squad, and I¡¯m sure they can handle
the depositions.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll be there,
Your Honor,¡± she said coolly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Mr. Figg?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯ll be there.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll get my clerk
to arrange the time, schedule, details, and we¡¯ll e-mail it to you by tomorrow.
Then, as soon as Mr. Figg designates his experts, we will schedule their
depositions. Ms. Karros, when your experts are in place, please provide the
necessary information, and we¡¯ll go from there. I want these initial
depositions out of the way within sixty days. Any questions?¡± There were none.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He continued: ¡°Now,
I have reviewed three other lawsuits involving this defendant and its products,
and, frankly, I¡¯m not impressed with Varrick¡¯s integrity or its ability to
abide by the rules of discovery. <a name=page155></a>The company, it seems, has
a great deal of trouble turning over documents to the other side. It has been
caught red-handed concealing documents. It has been sanctioned by judges at the
state and federal levels. It has been embarrassed before juries and paid dearly
with large verdicts, yet it continues to hide documents. At least three times,
its executives have been charged with perjury. Ms. Karros, how can you assure
me that your client will play by the rules?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She glared at the
judge, paused for a moment in a stare-down, then said, ¡°I was not the attorney
for Varrick Labs in those other cases, Your Honor, and I don¡¯t know what
happened there. I will not be tainted by lawsuits I had nothing to do with. I
know the rules inside and out, and my clients always play by the rules.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯ll see. Your
client needs to be warned that I am watching closely. At the first hint of a
discovery violation, I will haul the CEO into this courtroom and draw blood. Do
you understand me, Ms. Karros?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I do.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Mr. Figg, you have
not yet made a request for documents. When might this happen?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯re working on
that now, Your Honor,¡± Wally said with as much confidence as possible. ¡°We
should have it in a couple of weeks.¡± Alisandros had promised an exhaustive
list of documents to be sought from Varrick but had yet to come through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m waiting on
you,¡± Seawright said. ¡°This is your lawsuit. You filed it, now let¡¯s get
going.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes sir,¡± Wally
replied anxiously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Anything else?¡± he
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Most of the lawyers
shook their heads. His Honor seemed to relax somewhat as he chewed on the cap
of his pen. He said, ¡°I¡¯m thinking this case might do well under Local Rule
83:19. Have you considered this, Mr. Figg?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Mr. Figg had not,
because Mr. Figg was not aware of Local Rule 83:19. He opened his mouth, but
only dry came forth. David quickly picked up the flag and spoke his first words
in court: ¡°We¡¯ve considered <a name=page156></a>that, Your Honor, but we have
not yet discussed it with Mr. Alisandros. We should make a decision within the
week.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Seawright looked at
Nadine Karros and said, ¡°And your response?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We are the defense,
Your Honor, and we are never eager to go to trial.¡± Her candor amused the
judge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally whispered to
David, ¡°What the hell¡¯s Rule 83:19?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David whispered
back, ¡°The Rocket Docket. Streamline the case. Balls to the wall.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We don¡¯t want
that, do we?¡± Wally hissed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No. We want to
settle and cash in.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No need to file a
motion, Mr. Figg,¡± His Honor said. ¡°I¡¯m placing this case in 83:19 status. On

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes sir,¡± Wally
managed to mumble.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright
tapped his gavel and said, ¡°We¡¯ll meet again in sixty days, and I expect Mr.

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As
David and Wally were stuffing files and notepads into their briefcases in hopes
of a fast exit, Nadine Karros sauntered over for a quick hello. ¡°Nice to meet
you, Mr. Figg, Mr. Zinc,¡± she said with a smile that made Wally¡¯s nervous heart
skip another beat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A pleasure,¡± he
said. David returned the smile as he shook her hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°This promises to
be a long, bruising fight,¡± she said, ¡°with a lot of money on the table. I try
to keep things on a professional level and hard feelings at a minimum. I¡¯m sure

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh yes,¡± Wally
gushed, and almost asked her to go have a drink. David wasn¡¯t as easily
manipulated. He saw her as a pretty face and a warm facade, but just below the
surface was a ruthless combatant who would enjoy watching you bleed in open
court.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I guess I¡¯ll see
you next Wednesday,¡± she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°If not sooner,¡±
Wally said, a lame attempt at humor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As she stepped away,

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Now that Helen was expecting and her future would
be consumed with the baby, her studies at Northwestern seemed less important.
She dropped one class because of morning sickness, and she was struggling with
motivational problems in most of her others. David was pushing her, delicately,
but she wanted to take a break. She was almost thirty-four, thrilled at the
prospect of becoming a mother, and losing interest quickly in a doctorate in
art history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On a frigid day in
March, they were having lunch in a caf&eacute; near the campus when Toni Vance,
Helen¡¯s friend from class, happened to drop by. David had met her only once.
She was ten years older and had two teenagers and a husband who had something
to do with containerized shipping. She also had the Burmese housekeeper with a
grandson who was alive but probably brain damaged. David had urged Helen to
push Toni to arrange a meeting, but the housekeeper had not been cooperative.
Snooping, without violating laws or anyone¡¯s privacy, David had learned that
the little boy was five years old and for the past two months had been in
intensive care at the Lakeshore Children¡¯s Hospital on Chicago¡¯s North Side.
His name was Thuya Khaing, and he had been born in Sacramento, so he was a U.S.
citizen. As for his parents, David had no way of knowing their immigration
status. Zaw, the housekeeper, supposedly had a green card.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I think Zaw would
talk to you now,¡± Toni said as she sipped an espresso.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page158></a><span
lang=EN>¡°When and where?¡± David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She glanced at her
watch. ¡°My next class is over at two, then I¡¯ll go home. Why don¡¯t you guys
stop by?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At 2:30, David and
Helen parked behind a Jaguar in the driveway of a striking contemporary house
in Oak Park. Whatever Mr. Vance did with containerized cargo, he did it well.
The house jutted here and there, up and down, with lots of glass and marble and
no discernible design. It tried desperately to be unique, and it succeeded
greatly. They finally located the front door and were met by Toni, who¡¯d found
time to change outfits and was no longer trying to look like a twenty-year-old
student. She led them to a sunroom with full views of the sky and clouds, and
moments later Zaw entered with a tray of coffees. Introductions were made.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David had never met
a Burmese woman, but he guessed her age at sixty. She was petite in her maid¡¯s
uniform, with short, graying hair and a face that seemed locked into a
perpetual smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Her English is
very good,¡± Toni said. ¡°Please join us, Zaw.¡± Zaw awkwardly sat on a small
stool near her boss.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How long have you
been in the United States?¡± David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Twenty year.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And you have
family here?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°My husband is

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And he¡¯s the
father of the grandson who¡¯s in the hospital?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She nodded slowly.
The smile vanished at the mention of the boy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Does the boy have

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She looked at Toni,
who said, ¡°It¡¯s okay, Zaw. You can trust these people. Mr. Zinc needs to hear
the story.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Zaw nodded and
began talking, her eyes glued to the floor. ¡°He <a name=page159></a>get real
tired all the time, sleep a lot, then bad pain here.¡± She tapped her stomach.
¡°He cry so hard because of the pain. Then he start to vomit, every day he
vomit, and he lose weight, get real skinny. We take him to doctor. They put him
in hospital and he go to sleep.¡± She touched her head. ¡°They think he has brain

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Did the doctor say
it was lead poisoning?¡±</span></p>

No hesitation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David nodded too as
he let this soak in. ¡°Does your grandson live with you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Next door.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Rogers Park. It¡¯s

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Why do you need to

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°To find the source

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Zaw rose quietly
and said, ¡°Excuse me, please.¡± A few seconds later, she was back with a small
plastic bag, from which she removed a set of pink plastic teeth, complete with

funny noise.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David held the

lang=EN>It was spitting snow when David and Helen found the apartment complex
after dark. The buildings were 1960s-style blocks of plywood and tar paper, a
few bricks on the steps, a few shrubs here and there. All the units were two
stories, some with boarded windows and obviously abandoned. There were a few
vehicles, all ancient imports from Japan. It was easy to get the impression
that the place would have been condemned, with bulldozers to follow, but for the
heroic efforts of the Burmese immigrants.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Zaw was waiting at
14B and led them a few steps to 14C. Thuya¡¯s parents looked to be about twenty
years old, but were really closer to forty. They looked exhausted, sad eyed,
and as frightened as any parents would be. They were appreciative that a real
lawyer would come to their home, though they were terrified of the legal system
and understood nothing about it. The mother, Lwin, hurried about preparing and
serving tea. The father, Zaw¡¯s son, went by Soe and, as the man of the house,
did most of the talking. His English was good, much better than his wife¡¯s. As
Zaw had said, he worked for a company that did all manner of tree work. His
wife cleaned offices downtown. It was obvious to both David and Helen that there
had been a lot of discussion before their arrival.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The apartment was
sparsely furnished but neat and clean. The only effort at decor was a large
photograph of Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner and most
famous dissident in Burma. Something was on the stove in the kitchen, and its
pungent aroma reeked of onions. In the car, the Zincs had vowed not to stay for
dinner in the unlikely event they were invited. Thuya¡¯s two sisters were not to
be seen or heard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The yellowish tea
was served in tiny cups, and after a sip or two Soe said, ¡°Why do you want to
talk to us?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David took his
first sip, hoped it would be his last, and said, ¡°Because if your son has in
fact been poisoned by lead, and if the lead <a name=page161></a>came from a toy
or something here in the apartment, then you may&#8212;and I emphasize the word
¡®may¡¯&#8212;have a case against the maker of the dangerous product. I would like to
investigate this matter, but I am making no promises.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You mean we could
get money?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Possibly. That¡¯s
the purpose of the case, or lawsuit, but first we need to dig a little deeper.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How much money?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Here, of course,
Wally would promise them anything. David had heard him promise&#8212;or practically
guarantee&#8212;a million or more to several of his Krayoxx clients.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I can¡¯t answer
that,¡± David said. ¡°It¡¯s too early. I would like to investigate, see if we can
put together a case, and take it one step at a time.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Helen was watching
her husband with admiration. He was doing a fine job in an arena where he knew
nothing and had no experience. He¡¯d never seen a lawsuit at Rogan Rothberg.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Okay,¡± Soe said.
¡°What now?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Two things,¡± David
said. ¡°First, I¡¯d like to have a look at his things&#8212;toys, books, bed&#8212;anything
that might be a source of lead. Second, I need for you to sign some papers that
will allow me to begin accumulating his medical records.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Soe nodded at Lwin,
who reached into a small box and removed a plastic ziploc bag. She opened it
and on the small coffee table lined up five pairs of fake teeth and fangs&#8212;blue,
black, green, purple, and red. Zaw added the pink ones from the afternoon
visit, and the set was complete.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°These called Nasty
Teeth,¡± Soe said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David stared at the
row of Nasty Teeth and for the first time felt the twinge of excitement of a
big lawsuit. He picked up the green ones&#8212;hard but pliable plastic, flexible
enough to open and close easily. He had no trouble seeing a pesky little
brother with these in his mouth, growling and snapping at his sisters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page162></a><span
lang=EN>¡°Your son played with these?¡± David asked. Lwin nodded sadly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Soe said, ¡°He like
them, kept them in his mouth. Tried to eat dinner with them one night.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who bought them?¡±
David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I did,¡± Soe said.
¡°I bought a few things for Halloween. Cost not too much.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Where did you buy
them?¡± David asked, almost holding his breath. He hoped for an answer like
Walmart, Kmart, Target, Sears, Macy¡¯s&#8212;some chain with deep pockets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°At market,¡± Soe
said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What market?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Big mall. Near
Logan Square.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Helen said,
¡°Probably the Mighty Mall,¡± and David¡¯s excitement waned a bit. The Mighty Mall
was a hodgepodge of cavernous metal buildings housing a maze of cramped stalls
and booths where one could find almost anything of legal value and many items
from the black market. Cheap clothing, household goods, old albums, athletic
gear, counterfeit CDs, used paperbacks, fake jewelry, toys, games, a million
things. The low prices attracted large crowds. Virtually all business was in
cash. Record keeping and receipts were not priorities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Did these come in
a package?¡± David asked. A package would provide the name of the manufacturer
and maybe the importer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, but it gone,¡±
Soe said. ¡°In garbage, long time ago.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No package,¡± Lwin
added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The apartment had
two bedrooms&#8212;one used by the parents, the other by the children. David followed
Soe as the women stayed in the den. Thuya¡¯s bed was a small mattress on the
floor near his sisters¡¯. The children had a small, cheap bookcase filled with
coloring books and paperbacks. Next to it was a plastic tub filled with boy
toys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°This his,¡± Soe
said, pointing to the tub.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°May I look through
it?¡± David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, please.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David dropped to
his knees and slowly went through the box&#8212;action figures, race cars, airplanes,
a pistol, and handcuffs, the usual <a name=page163></a>assortment of
inexpensive toys for a five-year-old boy. When he stood, he said, ¡°I¡¯ll look at
these later. For now, just make sure that everything stays here.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Back in the den,
the Nasty Teeth were ziplocked again. David explained that he would send them
to an expert on lead poisoning and have them evaluated. If the teeth did indeed
contain unsuitable levels of lead, then they would meet again and discuss the
lawsuit. He cautioned that it might be difficult to pin down the maker of the
toys, and he tried to dampen any enthusiasm for the thought of one day
collecting money. The three&#8212;Zaw, Lwin, and Soe&#8212;seemed as puzzled and
apprehensive when the Zincs were leaving as they¡¯d been when they arrived. Soe
was on his way to the hospital to spend the night with Thuya.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The
following morning, David sent by overnight parcel the set of Nasty Teeth to a
lab in Akron. Its director, Dr. Biff Sandroni, was a leading expert on lead
poisoning in children. He also sent a check for $2,500, not from Finley &amp;
Figg, but from his personal bank account. David had yet to discuss the case
with his two bosses and planned to avoid doing so until more was known.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Sandroni called two
days later to say he had received the package, and the check, and that it would
be a week or so before he could get around to testing the teeth. He was keenly interested
because he had never seen a toy designed to be placed in the mouth. Virtually
every toy he examined was one that a child chewed on for whatever reasons. The
likely sources of the toy were China, Mexico, and India, and without the
package it would be virtually impossible to determine the importer and
manufacturer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Sandroni was a big
talker and went on about his most significant cases. He testified all the
time&#8212;¡°love the courtroom¡±&#8212;and took full responsibility for several
million-dollar verdicts. He called David ¡°David¡± and insisted on being called
Biff. As David listened, he could not remember another conversation with
someone named <a name=page164></a>Biff. The bluster would have worried David
but for his research into lead-poisoning experts. Dr. Sandroni was a warrior
with impeccable credentials.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At
7:00 the next Saturday morning, David and Helen found the Mighty Mall and
parked in a crowded lot. Traffic was thick; the place already busy. It was
thirty degrees outside and not much warmer inside. They waited in a long line
for beverages, bought two tall cups of hot cocoa, then began roaming. As
chaotic as the market appeared, there was some semblance of organization. The
food vendors were near the front, with such takeaway delicacies as Pronto Pups,
doughnuts, and cotton candy drawing fans. Then a stretch of booths offering
inexpensive clothing and shoes. Another long aisle was lined with books and
jewelry, then furniture and auto parts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The shoppers, as
well as the vendors, were of all shades and colors. Along with English and
Spanish, there were many other languages: Asian tongues, something from Africa,
then a loud voice that was probably Russian.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David and Helen
moved with the crowd, stopping occasionally to inspect something of interest.
After an hour, and with the hot cocoa growing cooler, they found the household
goods section, then the toys. There were three booths offering thousands of
cheap gadgets and playthings, none of which resembled a set of Nasty Teeth. The
Zincs were well aware they were months away from Halloween and were unlikely to
find costumes and such.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David picked up a
package containing three different dinosaurs, all small enough for a toddler to
chew on but too large to swallow. All three were painted shades of green. Only
a scientist like Sandroni could scrape off the paint and test for lead, but
after a month of exhaustive research David was convinced that most of the
cheapest toys were contaminated. The dinosaurs were sold by Larkette
Industries, Mobile, Alabama, and made in China. He had seen the name Larkette
as a defendant in several lawsuits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page165></a><span
lang=EN>As he held the dinosaurs, his mind was carried away by the absurdity of
it all. A cheap toy is made five thousand miles away, for pennies, decorated
with lead paint, imported into the United States, passed along the distribution
system until it lands here, in a giant flea market, where it¡¯s offered for
$1.99, where it¡¯s purchased by the poorest customers, taken home, presented to
the child, who chews on it, then ends up in a hospital, brain damaged and ruined
for life. Where are all of those consumer protection laws, inspectors,
bureaucrats?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Not to mention the
hundreds of thousands of dollars required to treat the child and support him
for his lifetime.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You buy?¡± the tiny
Hispanic woman barked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No thanks,¡± David
said, coming back to reality. He placed the toys back in the pile and turned
away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Any sign of Nasty
Teeth?¡± he asked as he stepped behind Helen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not a thing.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m freezing.
Let¡¯s get out of here.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>As scheduled by Judge Seawright¡¯s clerk, the
depositions of Finley &amp; Figg¡¯s Krayoxx clients began promptly at 9:00 a.m.
in a ballroom of the Downtown Marriott. Since the defendant, Varrick Labs, was
picking up the tab for the depositions, there was a generous spread of rolls and
pastries, along with coffee, tea, and juice. A long table had been arranged
with a video camera at one end and a witness chair at the other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Iris Klopeck was
the first witness. She had called 911 the day before and rode in an ambulance
to the hospital, where they treated her for arrhythmia and hypertension. Her
nerves were shot, and she told Wally several times she could not go through
with the lawsuit. He mentioned, more than once, that if she could tough it out,
she would soon be receiving a large check, ¡°probably a million bucks,¡± and this
helped somewhat. Also helping was a supply of Xanax, so when Iris took the
witness chair and looked at the legion of lawyers, she was fairly glassy-eyed
and drifting off to la-la land. Still, she at first froze and looked helplessly
at her lawyer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s just a
deposition,¡± Wally had repeated. ¡°There¡¯ll be a lot of lawyers there, but
they¡¯re nice people, for the most part.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They didn¡¯t look
nice. To her left was a line of intense young men in dark suits and frowns.
They were already scratching away on their yellow legal pads, and she hadn¡¯t
said a word. The nearest lawyer to her <a name=page167></a>was an attractive
woman who smiled and helped Iris settle down. To her right were Wally and his
two sidekicks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The woman said,
¡°Ms. Klopeck, my name is Nadine Karros, and I¡¯m the lead lawyer for Varrick
Labs. We¡¯re going to take your deposition over the next two hours, and I want
you to try to relax. I promise I will not try to trick you. If you don¡¯t
understand a question, don¡¯t answer it. I¡¯ll just repeat it. Are you ready?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes,¡± Iris said,
seeing double.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Next to Iris was a
court reporter who said, ¡°Raise your right hand.¡± Iris did so, then swore to
tell the truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ms. Karros said,
¡°Now, Ms. Klopeck, I¡¯m sure your attorneys have explained that we are making a
video of your deposition, and this might be used in court if for some reason
you¡¯re unable to testify. Do you understand this?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I think so.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So if you¡¯ll look
at the camera when you talk, we¡¯ll do just fine.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll try, yes, I
can do that.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Great. Ms.
Klopeck, are you currently taking any medication?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Iris stared at the
camera as if waiting for it to tell her what to say. She took eleven pills a
day for diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol, erratic heartbeat, arthritis,
kidney stones, and a few other ailments, but the one she worried about was
Xanax because it could affect her mental state. Wally had suggested she skip
any discussion about Xanax if asked the question, and here, right off the bat,
Ms. Karros was digging.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She giggled. ¡°Sure,
I¡¯m on a lot of meds.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It took fifteen
minutes to straighten them out, with no help from the Xanax, and just when Iris
got to the bottom of the list, she remembered another one and blurted, ¡°And I
used to take Krayoxx but not anymore. That stuff¡¯ll kill you.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally roared with
laughter. Oscar thought it was funny too. David suppressed a chuckle by looking
directly across the table at the stone-faced boys from Rogan Rothberg, not a
single one of whom would <a name=page168></a>allow himself even a grin. But
Nadine smiled and said, ¡°Is that all, Ms. Klopeck?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I think so,¡± she
said, still not sure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So, you¡¯re taking
nothing that would affect your judgment, memory, or ability to give truthful
answers?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Iris glanced at
Wally, who hid behind a legal pad, and for a second it was obvious that
something was going unsaid. ¡°That¡¯s correct,¡± Iris said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Nothing for
depression, stress, panic attacks, anxiety disorders?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was as if Ms.
Karros were reading Iris¡¯s mind and knew she was lying. Iris was about to choke
when she said, ¡°Not normally.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ten minutes later
they were still grappling with ¡°not normally,¡± and Iris finally admitted that
she popped a Xanax ¡°every now and then.¡± She proved sufficiently elusive,
though, when Ms. Karros tried to pin her down on her Xanax use. She stumbled
when she referred to the drug as her ¡°happy pills,¡± but plowed on. In spite of
her thick tongue and drooping eyelids, Iris assured the wall of lawyers to her
left that she was clearheaded and ready to roll.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Address, birth
dates, family members, employment, education, the deposition quickly sank into
tedium as Nadine and Iris fleshed out the Klopeck family, with emphasis on
Percy, the departed. Iris, with increasing lucidity, managed to choke up twice
when talking about her beloved husband, dead now for almost two years. Ms.
Karros probed into Percy¡¯s health and habits&#8212;drinking, smoking, exercise,
diet&#8212;and as much as she tried to whip the old boy into shape, Iris did a fair
job of portraying him with accuracy. Percy came across as a fat, sick man who
ate bad food, drank too much beer, and rarely left the sofa. ¡°But he quit
smoking,¡± Iris added at least twice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They took a break
after an hour, and Oscar excused himself, saying he had to be in court, but
Wally was suspicious. He had arm-twisted his senior partner to show up at the
depositions, sort of a show of force in the face of the ground troops Rogan
Rothberg would send in, though it was doubtful the presence of Oscar Finley
would rattle the defense. When fully manned, the Finley &amp; Figg side of the
table had <a name=page169></a>three lawyers, now minus one. Ten feet away, on
the other side, Wally counted eight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Seven lawyers to
sit and take the same notes while one did the talking? Ridiculous. But then
Wally began thinking, as Iris droned on, that perhaps the show of force was a
good thing. Perhaps Varrick was so worried that they had instructed Rogan
Rothberg to spare no expense. Maybe Finley &amp; Figg had them on the ropes and
didn¡¯t realize it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When they resumed
the deposition, Nadine prompted Iris to begin talking about Percy¡¯s medical
history, and Wally zoned out. He was still irritated that Jerry Alisandros had
once again skipped the proceedings. At first, Alisandros had big plans to
attend the depositions with his entourage, to make his first dramatic entrance
into the case, to do battle with Rogan Rothberg and stake out some turf. But
another last-minute urgency, this one in Seattle, proved more important. ¡°It¡¯s
only depositions,¡± Alisandros told an agitated Wally on the phone the day
before. ¡°Pretty basic stuff.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Basic indeed. Iris
was talking about one of Percy¡¯s old hernias.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David¡¯s role was
limited. He was there as a warm body, a real lawyer taking up space, but with
little to do but scribble and read. He was reviewing an FDA study on lead
poisoning in children.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Occasionally, Wally
would politely say, ¡°Objection. Calls for conclusion.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The lovely Ms.
Karros would stop and wait to make sure Wally was finished, then she would say,
¡°You may answer, Ms. Klopeck.¡± And by then, Iris would tell her all she wanted
to hear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright¡¯s
strict two-hour time limit was obeyed. Ms. Karros asked her last question at
10:58, then graciously thanked Iris for being such a good witness. Iris was
going for her purse where the Xanax was kept. Wally walked her to the door and
assured her she had done a superb job.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°When do you think
they¡¯ll want to settle?¡± she whispered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally put a finger
to his lips and shoved her out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Next up was Millie
Marino, widow of Chester and stepmother of Lyle, the inheritor of the baseball
card collection and Wally¡¯s initial <a name=page170></a>source of information
about Krayoxx. Millie was forty-nine, attractive, somewhat fit, reasonably well
dressed, and apparently unmedicated, a far cry from the last witness. She was
there for her depo, but she was still not a believer in the lawsuit. She and
Wally were still bickering over her late husband¡¯s estate. She was still
threatening to pull out of the lawsuit and find another lawyer. Wally had
offered to guarantee, in writing, a million-dollar settlement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ms. Karros asked
the same questions. Wally made the same objections. David read the same memo
and thought, Only six more after this one.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After
a quick lunch, the lawyers reconvened for the deposition of Adam Grand, the
assistant manager of an all-you-can-eat pizza house whose mother had died the
previous year after taking Krayoxx for two years. (It was the same pizza house
Wally now frequented, but only to secretly leave copies of his ¡°Beware of
Krayoxx!¡± brochures in the restrooms.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine Karros took
a break, and her number two, Luther Hotchkin, handled the deposition. Nadine,
though, apparently loaned him her questions because he asked the same ones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>During his
insufferable career at Rogan Rothberg, David had heard many tales about the
boys in litigation. The litigators were a breed apart, wild men who gambled
with huge sums of money, took enormous risks, and lived on the edge. In every
large law firm, the litigation section was the most colorful and filled with
the biggest characters and egos. That was the urban legend anyway. Now, as he
glanced occasionally across the table at the solemn faces of his adversaries,
he had serious doubts about the legend. Nothing he had ever experienced in his
career was as monotonous as sitting through depositions. And this was only his
third one. He almost missed the drudgery of plodding through the financial
records of obscure Chinese corporations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ms. Karros was
taking a break, but she missed nothing. This early <a name=page171></a>round of
depositions was nothing more than a little contest, a pageant to provide her
and her client the opportunity to meet and examine the eight contestants and
select a winner. Could Iris Klopeck withstand the rigors of an intense two-week
trial? Probably not. She was stoned during her depo, and Nadine had two
associates already working on her medical records. On the other hand, some
jurors might have great sympathy for her. Millie Marino would make an
impressive witness, but her husband, Chester, could potentially have the
strongest link to heart disease and death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine and her team
would finish the depos, watch them again and again, and slowly eliminate the
better ones. They and their experts would continue to dissect the medical
records of the eight ¡°victims¡± and eventually select the one with the weakest
claim. When they picked their winner, they would race to court with a thick,
cold-blooded, and well-reasoned motion to separate. They would ask Judge
Seawright to take the single case they wanted, place it on his Rocket Docket,
and clear all obstacles between it and a trial by jury.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Minutes
after 6:00 p.m., David bolted from the Marriott and almost ran to his car. He
was punch-drunk and needed his lungs full of cold air. Leaving downtown, he
stopped at a Starbucks in a strip mall and ordered a double espresso. Two doors
down was a party store that advertised costumes and favors, and, as had become
his habit, he wandered over for a look. No party store was safe from him, or
Helen, these days. They were searching for a set of Nasty Teeth, in the
wrapper, with names of corporations in fine print. This one had the usual
inventory of cheap costumes, gag gifts, decorations, glitter, toys, wrapping
paper. There were several sets of vampire teeth, made in Mexico and sold by a
company called Mirage Novelties of Tucson.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He was familiar
with Mirage, even had a small file on the company. Privately owned, sales last
year of $18 million, most of its products along the same lines of what David
was now inspecting. He had <a name=page172></a>files on dozens of companies
that specialized in cheap toys and gadgets, and his research was growing daily.
What he had not found was another set of Nasty Teeth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He paid three bucks
for a set of fangs, to add to his growing collection, then drove to the
Brickyard Mall, where he met Helen at a Lebanese restaurant. Over dinner, he
refused to describe his day&#8212;the same ordeal was planned for tomorrow&#8212;so they
chatted about her classes and, not surprisingly, the coming addition to their
family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Lakeshore
Children¡¯s Hospital was nearby. They found the ICU, then found Soe Khaing in a
visitors¡¯ room. He had relatives with him, and introductions were made, though
neither David nor Helen caught a single name. The Burmese were visibly touched
that the Zincs would stop by and say hello.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Thuya¡¯s condition
had changed little in the past month. The day after their visit to the family¡¯s
apartment, David had contacted one of the doctors. After he e-mailed the
paperwork signed by Soe and Lwin, the doctor was willing to talk. The boy¡¯s
outlook was bleak. The level of lead in his body was highly toxic, with
substantial damage to his kidneys, liver, nervous system, and brain. He was in
and out of consciousness. If he survived, it would take months or years to
gauge the level of impaired brain activity. Normally, though, with this much
lead, children did not survive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David and Helen
followed Soe down the hall, past a nurse¡¯s station, and to a window where they
could see Thuya strapped to a small bed and hooked to an astonishing assortment
of tubes, lines, and monitors. His breathing was aided by a respirator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I touch him once a
day. He hear me,¡± Soe said, then wiped the moisture from his cheeks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David and Helen
stared through the window but could think of nothing to say.</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Another aspect of big-firm life that David had
learned to despise was the endless meetings. Meetings to evaluate and review,
to discuss the firm¡¯s future, to plan everything, to greet new lawyers, to say
good-bye to old ones, to stay current on the law, to mentor rookies, to get
mentored by senior partners, to talk about compensation, labor issues, and an
endless list of other incredibly boring topics. The Rogan Rothberg culture was
nonstop work and nonstop billing, but there were so many useless meetings that
the making of money was actually often impeded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With that in mind,
David reluctantly suggested his new firm have a meeting. He¡¯d been there four
months and had settled into a comfortable routine. He was worried, though,
about the lack of civility and communication among the other members of the
firm. The Krayoxx litigation was dragging on. Wally¡¯s dreams of a quick jackpot
were fading, and revenue was down. Oscar was increasingly more irritable, if
that was possible. In gossiping with Rochelle, David learned that the partners
never sat around the table to think strategically and to air complaints.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar said he was
too busy. Wally said such a meeting was a waste. Rochelle thought the idea was
awful until she realized she would be invited, then she became enamored with
the idea. As the only non-lawyer employee, she thought the idea of being
allowed a soapbox was <a name=page174></a>appealing. With time, David was able
to cajole the senior and junior partners, and Finley &amp; Figg scheduled its
inaugural firm meeting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They waited until
5:00 p.m., then locked the front door and put the phones on hold. After a few
awkward moments, David said, ¡°Oscar, as the senior partner, I think you should
run the meeting.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What do you want
to talk about?¡± Oscar shot back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Glad you asked,¡±
David said as he quickly passed around an agenda. Number 1: Fee Schedule.
Number 2: Case Review. Number 3: Filing. Number 4: Specialization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°This is just a
suggestion,¡± David said. ¡°Frankly, I don¡¯t care what we talk about, but it¡¯s
important for each of us to be able to unload.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You spent too much
time in a big firm,¡± Oscar said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So what¡¯s bugging
you?¡± Wally asked David.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Nothing¡¯s bugging
me. It¡¯s just that I think we could do a better job of keeping our fees uniform
and reviewing each other¡¯s cases. The filing system is twenty years out of
date, and as a firm we¡¯re not going to make money if we don¡¯t specialize.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, speaking of
money,¡± Oscar said, picking up a notepad. ¡°Since we filed these Krayoxx cases,
our gross has declined for three straight months. We¡¯re spending far too much
time on those cases, and our cash is getting low. That¡¯s what¡¯s bugging me.¡± He
was staring at Wally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The payoff¡¯s
coming,¡± Wally said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s what you
keep saying.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯ll settle the
Groomer car wreck next month and net around twenty grand. It¡¯s not unusual to
go through a dry period, Oscar. Hell, you¡¯ve been doing this a long time. You
know the ups and downs. Last year we lost money nine months outta twelve, and
we still showed a nice profit.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There was a loud
knock on the front door. Wally jumped to his feet and said, ¡°Oh no, it¡¯s
DeeAnna. Sorry, guys, I told her to take the day off.¡± He raced to the door and
opened it. She made her entrance&#8212;skintight black leather pants, hooker¡¯s heels,
tight cotton sweater. Wally <a name=page175></a>said, ¡°Hey, honey, we¡¯re having
a little meeting. What say you wait in my office?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How long?¡± she
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not long.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>DeeAnna smiled like
a tart at Oscar and David as she strutted by. Wally led her to his office and
closed her inside. He sat down at the table, slightly embarrassed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Know what¡¯s
bugging me?¡± Rochelle asked. ¡°Her.¡± She nodded toward Wally¡¯s office. ¡°Why does
she have to stop by every afternoon?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You used to see
clients after five,¡± Oscar jumped in. ¡°Now you¡¯re just locked in there with
her.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She¡¯s not
bothering anyone,¡± Wally said. ¡°And not so loud.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She bothers me,¡±
Rochelle said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally raised both
palms, arched his eyebrows, and was instantly ready for a brawl. ¡°Look, she and
I are getting serious, and it¡¯s none of your business. Got that? I¡¯m not going
to discuss it further.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There was a pause
as everyone took a breath, then Oscar launched another round. ¡°I suppose you¡¯ve
told her about Krayoxx and the big settlement that¡¯s just around the corner, so
it¡¯s not surprising she¡¯s hanging around. Right?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t talk about
your women, Oscar,¡± Wally fired back. Women? More than one? Rochelle¡¯s eyes
widened, and David remembered all the good reasons for hating firm meetings.
Oscar glared at Wally in disbelief for several seconds. Both men appeared
stunned at their exchange.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Let¡¯s move along,¡±
David said. ¡°I¡¯d like permission to study our fee structure and attempt to come
up with a proposed schedule that will aim for uniformity. Any objections?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There were none.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On a roll, David
quickly passed around some sheets of paper. ¡°This is a case I¡¯ve stumbled
across, and it has great potential.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Nasty Teeth?¡±
Oscar said, looking at a color photo of the collection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yep. The client is
a five-year-old boy in a coma from lead poisoning. <a name=page176></a>His
father purchased this set of teeth and fangs last Halloween, and the kid kept them
in his mouth for hours. The various paint colors are loaded with lead. Page 3
is a preliminary report from a lab in Akron where one Dr. Biff Sandroni
examined the teeth. His conclusion is at the bottom&#8212;all six sets of plastic
teeth are coated with lead. Dr. Sandroni is an expert on lead poisoning, and he
says this is one of the worst products he¡¯s come across in the last twenty-five
years. He thinks the teeth were probably made in China and imported by one of
the many low-end toy companies here in the States. Chinese factories have a
terrible history of coating a million different products with lead paint. The
Food and Drug Administration and the Bureau of Consumer Protection scream and
order recalls, but it¡¯s impossible to monitor everything.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle, looking
at the same handout as Oscar and Wally, said, ¡°That poor child. Is he gonna
make it?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The doctors think
not. There¡¯s substantial damage to his brain, nervous system, and many of his
organs. If he lives, he¡¯ll be a very sad sight.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who¡¯s the manufacturer?¡±
Wally asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s the big
question. I¡¯ve been unable to find another set of Nasty Teeth in Chicago, and
Helen and I have been poking around for a month. Nothing online. Nothing in
suppliers¡¯ catalogs. So far, no clue. It¡¯s possible that the product shows up
at Halloween only. The family did not keep the package.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°There must be
similar products,¡± Wally said. ¡°I mean, if the company makes crap like this,
then surely it makes crap like fake mustaches and such.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s my theory.
I¡¯m accumulating a nice collection of similar items, and I¡¯m researching the
importers and manufacturers.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who paid for this
report?¡± Oscar asked, suspiciously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I did. Twenty-five
hundred bucks.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>This caused a gap
in the conversation as all four looked at the report. Finally, Oscar asked,
¡°Have the parents signed a contract with our firm?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page177></a><span
lang=EN>¡°No. They¡¯ve signed a contract with me so I could get the medical
records and begin the investigation. They¡¯ll sign one with the firm if I ask
them to. The question is simply this: Does Finley &amp; Figg take this case? If
the answer is yes, then we need to spend some money.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How much?¡± Oscar
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The next step is
to hire Sandroni¡¯s outfit to go into the apartment where the boy and his family
live and look for lead. It could be in other toys, paint on the walls that¡¯s
chipping, even in the drinking water. I¡¯ve been to the apartment, and it¡¯s at
least fifty years old. Sandroni needs to isolate the source of the lead. He¡¯s
fairly confident we have the source, but he wants to exclude everything else.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And how much does
that cost?¡± Oscar asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Twenty thousand.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar¡¯s jaw
dropped, and he shook his head. Wally whistled and scattered the sheets of
paper. Only Rochelle was hanging on, and she really didn¡¯t have a vote when the
issue was spending money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°With no defendant,
there¡¯s no lawsuit,¡± Oscar said. ¡°Why burn cash investigating this when you
don¡¯t know who to sue?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll find the
manufacturer,¡± David said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Great, and when
you do, then we have ourselves a lawsuit, maybe.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The door to Wally¡¯s
office rattled, then opened. DeeAnna took a step out and said, ¡°Wally, how much
longer, baby?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Just a few
minutes,¡± Wally said. ¡°We¡¯re almost finished here.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But I¡¯m tired of
waiting.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Okay, okay. I¡¯ll
be there in a minute.¡± She slammed the door and the walls shook.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I guess she¡¯s now
running the firm meeting,¡± Rochelle observed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Knock it off,¡±
Wally said to Rochelle, then to David he continued: ¡°I like this case, David, I
really do. But with the Krayoxx litigation in full swing, we can¡¯t commit to
spending big money on another case. I say you put this on hold, maybe keep
looking for the importer, and after we settle Krayoxx, we¡¯ll be in a great
position to pick and choose. You¡¯ve got this family signed up. This kid ain¡¯t
going anywhere. Let¡¯s keep it on a leash and crank it up next year.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page178></a><span

would say yes if she had a vote, but she was losing interest. ¡°Fair enough,¡±

own money, and under the protection of my own malpractice policy.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You have your own

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, but I¡¯ll get
one easy enough.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What about the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°True, but each

helping a little boy,¡± Oscar shot back. ¡°It¡¯s about financing the lawsuit. I

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Because I don¡¯t

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>The great Jerry Alisandros finally made his
appearance on the Chicago stage of his grand war against Varrick, and his
arrival was impressive. First, he landed in the Gulfstream G650 that Wally was
still dreaming of. Second, he brought with him an entourage that rivaled the one
that surrounded Nadine Karros when she went to court. With Zell &amp; Potter
front and center, the playing field seemed level. Third, he had the skill,
experience, and national reputation one would never find at Finley &amp; Figg.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar skipped the
hearing because he wasn¡¯t needed. Wally couldn¡¯t wait to get there so he could
strut in with his stud co-counsel. David tagged along out of curiosity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine Karros, her
team, and her client had selected Iris Klopeck as their guinea pig, though
neither her attorneys nor Iris herself had the slightest whiff of the master
scheme. Varrick had filed a motion to separate the plaintiffs¡¯ cases, to make
eight different lawsuits out of one, and to keep the litigation in Chicago
instead of having it lumped with thousands of other cases in the brand-new
multi-district litigation in southern Florida. The plaintiffs¡¯ lawyers opposed
these motions strenuously. Thick briefs had been swapped. The mood was tense
when the squads of lawyers gathered in Judge Seawright¡¯s courtroom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As they waited, a
clerk came forth and announced that the judge was delayed by some urgent matter
but should be out in half an hour. David was loitering near the plaintiffs¡¯
table, chatting with a Zell &amp; <a name=page180></a>Potter associate, when a
defense lawyer slid over for a contrived hello. David vaguely recognized him
from somewhere in the halls of Rogan Rothberg, but he had tried hard to forget
those people. ¡°I¡¯m Taylor Barkley,¡± the guy said on top of a quick handshake.
¡°Harvard, two years ahead of you.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A pleasure,¡± David
said, then introduced Barkley to the Zell &amp; Potter lawyer he had just met.
For a few minutes they chatted about the Cubs and the weather and finally got
around to the issue at hand. Barkley claimed to be working around the clock as
Rogan was getting slammed with Krayoxx work. David had lived that life, and
survived it, and he had no desire to hear it again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Should be a hell
of a trial,¡± David said to fill in a gap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Barkley snorted as
if he had the inside scoop. ¡°What trial?¡± he said. ¡°These cases will never get
near a jury. You know that, don¡¯t you?¡± he asked, looking at the Zell &amp;
Potter associate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Barkley continued,
half under his breath because the place was crawling with wired lawyers. ¡°We¡¯ll
defend like hell for a while, pad the file, rack up some obscene fees, then
advise our dear client to settle. You¡¯ll figure out this game, Zinc. If you
stay in it long enough.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m catching on,¡±
David said, watching every word. He and the Zell &amp; Potter associate were
both on their heels, absorbing but not believing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°For what it¡¯s
worth,¡± Barkley said, in a whisper, ¡°you¡¯re almost a legend around Rogan these
days. A guy with the balls to walk away, go find an easier job, now sitting on
a pile of cases that are a gold mine. We¡¯re still slaving away by the hour.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David just nodded,
hoping he would go away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The courtroom
deputy suddenly came to life and ordered everyone to stand. Judge Seawright
swept in from behind the bench and ordered everyone to sit. ¡°Good morning,¡± he
said into his mike as he arranged his papers. ¡°We have a lot of ground to cover
in the next two hours, and, as always, brevity with words will be appreciated.
I am monitoring discovery, and it appears as though things are proceeding on
course. Mr. Alisandros, do you have any complaints about discovery?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page181></a><span
lang=EN>Jerry stood proudly because everyone was watching. He had long gray
hair swept back over his ears and bunched around his neck. His skin was well
tanned, and his custom-tailored suit hung perfectly on his lean frame. ¡°No sir,
Your Honor, not at this time. And I am delighted to be in your courtroom.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Welcome to
Chicago. Ms. Karros, do you have any complaints with discovery?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She stood, in her
light gray silk and linen dress, V-neck, Empire waist, tight down the slender
legs, long below the knee, with black platform pumps, and all eyes feasted upon
her. David was looking forward to the trial just to watch the fashion show.
Wally was drooling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Your Honor, we
exchanged lists of experts this morning, so everything is in order,¡± she said,
her voice rich, her diction perfect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Very well,¡±
Seawright said. ¡°That leads to the biggest issue of the day&#8212;that of where these
cases will be tried. The plaintiffs have filed a motion to move all the cases,
to join the multi-district litigation in federal court in Miami. The defendant
objects, and not only prefers to keep the cases here in Chicago, but also to
separate them, try them one at a time, beginning with the estate of one Percy
Klopeck, now deceased. These issues have been thoroughly and exhaustively briefed.
I¡¯ve read every word. At this point, I¡¯ll allow remarks by both sides,
beginning with the attorneys for the plaintiffs.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Jerry Alisandros
walked with his notes to a small podium in the center of the courtroom,
directly in front of and several feet below Judge Seawright. He carefully
arranged his papers, cleared his throat, and began with the typical ¡°If it
pleases the court.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For
Wally, it was the most exciting moment in his career. To think he, a hustler
from the Southwest Side, was sitting in federal court watching great lawyers do
battle over cases he had found and filed, cases he was responsible for, cases
he had created&#8212;it was almost too much to behold. As he suppressed a grin, he
felt even better when he touched his midsection and slid a finger under his
belt. Down fifteen pounds. <a name=page182></a>Sober for 195 days. The lost
weight and clear head were no doubt linked to the indescribable fun he and
DeeAnna were having in bed. He was eating Viagra, driving a new convertible
Jaguar (new to him but slightly used and financed over sixty months), and
feeling twenty years younger. As he buzzed around Chicago with the top down, he
dreamed endlessly of his Krayoxx money and the glorious life ahead. He and
DeeAnna would travel and lie on beaches, and he would work only when necessary.
He had already decided that he would specialize in mass torts, forget the
humdrum of the street, the cheap divorces and drunk drivers, and go for the big
money. He was certain he and Oscar would split. Frankly, after twenty years, it
was time. Though he loved him like a brother, Oscar had no ambition, no vision,
no real desire to step up his game. He and Oscar had already had a conversation
about how to hide their Krayoxx money so his wife would see little of it. Oscar
would go through a bad divorce, and Wally would be there to support him, but
when it was over, the partners would split. It was sad but inevitable. Wally
was going places; Oscar was too old to change.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Jerry
Alisandros got off to a bad start when he tried to argue that Judge Seawright
had no choice but to transfer the cases to Miami. ¡°These cases were filed in
Chicago, not Miami,¡± the judge reminded Alisandros. ¡°No one made you file them
here. I suppose you could¡¯ve filed them anywhere you can find Varrick Labs,
which I presume is in any of the fifty states. I¡¯m having trouble understanding
why a federal judge in Florida thinks he can order a federal judge in Illinois
to transfer his cases down there. Can you help me here, Mr. Alisandros?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Mr. Alisandros
could not. He tried valiantly to suggest that nowadays in mass tort litigation
it is customary to establish multi-district litigation and have only one judge
preside over all the cases.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Customary, but not
mandatory. Seawright seemed irritated that someone, anyone would suggest that
he was required to move the cases. They were his!</span></p>

<p class=Para06 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.5pt'><span lang=EN>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page183></a><span
lang=EN>David sat behind Wally in a row of chairs in front of the bar. He was
enthralled by the drama of the courtroom, the pressure, the high stakes, but he
was also worried because it was apparent Judge Seawright was against them on
this issue. However, Alisandros had assured their team that winning these
initial motions was not crucial. If Varrick Labs wanted to try a single test
case in Chicago, and to do so quickly, then so be it. He had never run away
from a trial in his career. Bring it on!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The judge, though,
seemed hostile. Why was David worried? There would be no trial, right? All the
lawyers on his side of the aisle believed secretly, fervently, that Varrick
Labs would settle its Krayoxx mess long before the trials started. And if
Barkley on the other side could be believed, the defense lawyers were also
thinking settlement. Was it a rigged game? Was this how the mass tort business
really worked? A bad drug gets discovered; the plaintiffs¡¯ lawyers go into a frenzy
rounding up the cases; lawsuits are filed; the big defense firms respond with
an endless supply of expensive legal talent; both sides slug it out until the
drugmaker gets tired of writing fat checks to its lawyers; then everything gets
settled; the plaintiffs¡¯ lawyers rake in huge fees, and their clients get far
less than they expected. When the dust settles, the lawyers on both sides are
richer; the company cleans up its balance sheet and develops a replacement
drug.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Was this nothing
more than good theater?</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Just
as Jerry Alisandros began to repeat himself, he sat down. The lawyers perked up
as Nadine Karros stood and walked to the podium. She had a few notes but didn¡¯t
use them. Since it was obvious the judge agreed with her, she kept her
arguments brief. She spoke in long eloquent sentences, as if they had been
written down with plenty of forethought. Her words were clear, her voice
carried nicely around the courtroom. Nothing was wasted&#8212;no extra verbiage, no
useless <a name=page184></a>gestures. The woman was meant for the stage. From
several angles, she made the point that there was no case, no rule of
procedure, no precedent anywhere that required a federal judge to transfer one
of his cases to another federal judge.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After
a few moments, David was wondering if he would actually get to watch Ms. Karros
in action before a jury. Did she know, at that very moment, there would be no
trial? Was she just going through the motions, at $2,000 an hour?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A month earlier
Varrick Labs reported its quarterly earnings, which were down significantly.
The company surprised analysts by writing off $5 billion for the projected
costs of ongoing litigation, primarily Krayoxx. David was following this
closely in financial publications and blogs. Opinion was split between those
who thought Varrick Labs would hurry and clean up its mess through a massive
settlement and those who thought the company might try to weather the storm
through hardball litigation. The stock price ping-ponged between $35 and $40
per share, so the stockholders seemed reasonably calm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He was also
studying the history of mass tort litigation and found it surprising the number
of times that a defendant corporation¡¯s stock rose impressively when it settled
and got rid of a bunch of lawsuits. There was normally a dip in the stock price
with the first wave of bad news and hysterics from the plaintiffs¡¯ bar, but as
battle lines were formed and the numbers became firm, Wall Street seemed to
prefer a good settlement. What Wall Street hated was ¡°squishy liability,¡± the
kind that was often seen when a big case was handed over to a jury and the
results were unpredictable. In the past ten years, virtually all of the major
mass tort cases involving pharmaceuticals had been settled, and for billions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On one hand, David
was finding comfort in the research. But on the other, it had turned up little
in the way of credible proof that Krayoxx did all the terrible things it was
accused of doing.</span></p>

<p class=Para06 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.5pt'><span lang=EN>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page185></a><span
lang=EN>After a thorough and fair debate, Judge Seawright had heard enough. He
thanked the lawyers for their preparation and promised a ruling within ten
days. The extra time was not needed&#8212;he could have ruled immediately from the
bench. There was little doubt he would keep the cases in Chicago, and he seemed
to favor the idea of a ¡°show trial.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The plaintiffs¡¯
lawyers retired to the Chicago Chop House, where Mr. Alisandros had reserved
the back room for a private lunch. Including Wally and David, there were seven
lawyers and two paralegals (all men), and they all took their places around an
oblong table. Jerry had preordered wine, and it was poured as soon as they sat
down. Wally and David declined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A toast,¡± Jerry
announced as he tapped his wineglass. Silence. ¡°I propose a toast to the Right
Honorable Harry Seawright and his famous Rocket Docket. The trap has been laid,
and the fools at Rogan Rothberg think we¡¯re blind. They want a trial. Old Harry
wants one too, so by God let¡¯s give ¡¯em a trial.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Everyone took a
sip, and within seconds the conversation spiraled down to an analysis of the
legs and backside of Nadine Karros. Wally, who had the right-hand seat to the
throne of Mr. Alisandros, offered comments that were deemed hilarious. Over
salads, the chatter quite naturally made its way to their second favorite
subject&#8212;settlement. David, who was saying as little as possible, was coaxed
into telling the story of his encounter with Taylor Barkley just before the
hearing. His narrative was received with great interest&#8212;too much, in his
opinion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was Jerry¡¯s
stage, and he did most of the talking. In equal parts, he was enthusiastic
about a big trial with a big verdict, but he was also supremely confident
Varrick would buckle and put billions on the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Hours later, David
was still confused, but he was also comforted by the presence of Jerry
Alisandros. The man had fought the wars, <a name=page186></a>inside the
courtroom and out, and he almost never lost. According to <span class=0Text>Lawyers
Weekly</span>, the thirty-five partners at Zell &amp; Potter split $1.3 billion
in net profits the previous year. Net, after new jets, a firm golf course, and
every other lavish expense allowed by the IRS. According to <span class=0Text>Florida
Business</span> magazine, Jerry¡¯s net worth was somewhere around $350 million.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Not a bad way to
practice law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David had not shown
these numbers to Wally.</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>For almost thirty years, Kirk Maxwell represented
Idaho in the U.S. Senate. He was generally well regarded as a steady hand who
shunned publicity and preferred to work off camera to get things done. He was
quiet, unassuming, and one of the more popular members of Congress. However, his
sudden death was nothing short of spectacular.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Maxwell had the
Senate floor, microphone in hand, arguing fiercely with a colleague from the
other side of the aisle, when he suddenly clutched his chest, dropped his mike,
opened his mouth in horror, and crashed forward into the back of the desk in
front of his. He died instantly of cardiac arrest, and it was all captured on
the official Senate camera, released without proper authorization, and seen by
the world on YouTube before his wife could get to the hospital.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Two days after his
funeral, his wayward son mentioned to a reporter that the senator had been
taking Krayoxx and the family was considering a lawsuit against Varrick Labs.
By the time this was digested through the 24/7 news cycle, there was little doubt
that the drug had killed the senator. Maxwell was only sixty-two, in fine
health, but with a family history of high cholesterol.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>An angry colleague
announced a subcommittee hearing into the hazards of Krayoxx. The Food and Drug
Administration was besieged with demands that the drug be pulled. Varrick Labs,
hunkered down in the hills outside of Montville, offered no comment. It was
another dark day for the company, but Reuben Massey had seen worse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page188></a><span
lang=EN>Such a lawsuit would be ironic for two reasons. First, in his thirty
years in Washington, Senator Maxwell had taken millions from Big Pharma and, as
far as the industry was concerned, had a perfect voting record. Second, the
senator was an ardent tort reformer who had voted for years to place severe
restrictions on the filing of lawsuits. But in the aftermath of a tragedy,
irony is often lost on those left behind. His widow hired a noted plaintiffs¡¯
lawyer in Boise, but for ¡°consultation only.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With
Krayoxx on the front page, Judge Seawright decided a trial might be interesting
after all. He ruled against the plaintiffs on all issues. The lawsuit Wally had
filed and then amended would be broken up into separate pieces, with the case
of the late Percy Klopeck being the first to get slotted into the fury of Local
Rule 83:19, the Rocket Docket.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was
panic-stricken when he received notice of the ruling, but he began to settle
down during a long and soothing conversation with Jerry Alisandros. Jerry
explained that the death of Senator Maxwell was a gift from heaven&#8212;in more ways
than one because a rabid tort reformer had been silenced&#8212;and would only
increase the pressure on Varrick to begin settlement talks. And besides, as
Jerry kept saying, he would welcome the chance to be on center stage versus the
lovely Ms. Karros in a packed Chicago courtroom. ¡°The last place they want to
see me is in a courtroom,¡± Jerry said again and again. His ¡°Klopeck trial unit¡±
was hard at work at that very moment. His firm had dealt with many egocentric
federal judges with their own special versions of their own little Rocket
Dockets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Seawright didn¡¯t
create the Rocket Docket?¡± Wally asked, innocently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Heavens, no,
Wally. I heard that term thirty years ago in upstate New York.¡± Jerry went on
to encourage Wally to continue combing the streets for more Krayoxx cases. ¡°I¡¯m
about to make you rich, Wally,¡± he said again and again.</span></p>

<p class=Para06 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page189></a><span
lang=EN>Two weeks after Senator Maxwell¡¯s death, the FDA caved and ordered
Krayoxx off the market. The mass tort bar was orgasmic, and lawyers in a dozen
cities issued statements to the press, most of the same variety: Varrick will
have to answer for its gross negligence. A federal investigation should be
launched. The FDA should never have approved the drug. Varrick knew it had
problems but had rushed the drug to market, where, in six years, it had grossed
over $30 billion for the company. Who knows what¡¯s really buried in the Varrick
research.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar was
conflicted by the news. On one hand, he, obviously, wanted the drug to generate
as much bad press as possible to force the company to come to the table. But on
the other hand, he was secretly, fervently hoping the drug would take care of
his wife. Pulling it would ratchet up the pressure on Varrick, but it would
also remove the drug from her medicine cabinet. Actually, Oscar¡¯s perfect
outcome would be breaking news of a pending settlement at about the same time
his wife croaked on the drug. He could keep all the money, avoid a messy
divorce, then file suit on behalf of his dear departed wife and nail Varrick
yet again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He dreamed of such
things behind his locked door. The phone lines were blinking nonstop, but he
refused to pick up. Most of the calls were from Wally¡¯s ¡°non-death cases,¡±
folks Wally had tracked down through his various schemes. Let Rochelle, Wally,
and young David worry about the calls and the frantic clients. Oscar planned to
stay in his office and avoid the frenzy, if possible.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle
was ready to quit, and she demanded another firm meeting. ¡°See what you¡¯ve

afternoon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What¡¯s on the
agenda?¡± Wally asked, though everyone knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle had
twisted David¡¯s arm to the point where he was willing to run interference. He
cleared his throat and got right to the point. <a name=page190></a>¡°We have to

ringing like crazy with people who either are already signed up or want to jump
on board.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Ain¡¯t it great?¡±
Wally said with a wide, satisfied grin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Maybe, Wally, but
this is not a mass tort firm. We¡¯re not equipped to handle four hundred cases
at a time. Your big mass tort boys have dozens of associates and even more
paralegals, lots of bodies to handle the work.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We have four
hundred cases?¡± Oscar asked, and it wasn¡¯t clear if he was pleased or
overwhelmed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally slurped down
some diet soda and said, proudly, ¡°We have the eight death cases, of course,
and 407 non-death cases, and counting. And I¡¯m sorry that these minor cases are
causing so much trouble, but when it¡¯s time to settle, and when we get to plug
these guys into the compensation grid hammered out by Jerry Alisandros, we¡¯ll
probably learn that each non-death is worth a paltry hundred thousand bucks or
so. Times 407. Anybody here want to do the math?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s not the
issue, Wally,¡± David countered. ¡°We get the math. What you¡¯re missing is the
fact that these cases may not be cases. Not a single one of these non-death

been harmed, do we?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, not yet, and

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The Krayoxx
Litigation Group. KLG for short.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Are we on the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Are you sure?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What is this?¡±
Wally growled angrily. ¡°Why is everybody hammering me? The first firm meeting
was all about my girlfriend. This one is all about my cases. I¡¯m starting to
dislike firm meetings. What¡¯s wrong with you guys?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m fed up with
these people on the phone,¡± Rochelle said. ¡°It¡¯s nonstop. Everybody¡¯s got a
story. Some are crying because you¡¯ve scared them to death, Wally. Some even
stop by and want me to hold their hands. They all think they got bad hearts
because of you and the FDA.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What if they do
have bad hearts, and their bad hearts are caused by Krayoxx, and we¡¯re able to
get them some cash? Isn¡¯t that what lawyers are supposed to do?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What if we hire a
paralegal for a few months?¡± David suggested, rather abruptly, then braced for
the reactions. When the other three didn¡¯t speak quickly enough, he plowed on.
¡°We can stick him or her in the junk room upstairs and send all the Krayoxx
cases up there. I¡¯ll help him or her set up the litigation software and filing
systems so that he or she is on top of every case. I¡¯ll supervise the project
if you want. All phone calls dealing with Krayoxx can be routed to the new
office. We take the pressure off Rochelle, and Wally can keep doing what he
does best&#8212;hustle cases.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯re not in a
position to hire anyone,¡± Oscar said, predictably. ¡°Our cash flow is far below
normal, thanks to Krayoxx. And, since you¡¯re not paying the bills yet, and not
even close to doing so, I might add, I don¡¯t think you¡¯re in a position to
suggest spending more money.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I understand,¡±
David said. ¡°I was just suggesting a way for the firm to get itself organized.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Actually, you¡¯re

aloud.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page192></a><span
lang=EN>Wally liked the idea but, at the moment, didn¡¯t have the spine to take
on his senior partner. Rochelle admired David for his boldness, but she wasn¡¯t
about to comment on an issue dealing with the overhead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I have a better
idea,¡± Oscar said to David. ¡°Why don¡¯t you become the Krayoxx paralegal? You¡¯re
already upstairs. You know something about litigation software. You¡¯re always
squawking about getting organized around here. You¡¯ve been wanting a new filing
system. Judging by your monthly grosses, it looks as though you have some spare
time. It¡¯ll save us some dough. Whatta you say?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was all true,
and David wasn¡¯t about to back down. ¡°Okay, what¡¯s my cut of the settlement?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar and Wally
looked at each other, all four eyes narrowing as this rattled around their
brains. They had not yet decided how they themselves would split the money.
There had been some loose chatter about a bonus for Rochelle and one for David,
but as for the real division of the spoils, not a word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯ll have to talk
about that,¡± Wally said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, this is a
matter for the partners,¡± Oscar added, as if being a partner in their firm were
akin to belonging to an exclusive and powerful club.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, hurry up and
decide something,¡± Rochelle said. ¡°I can¡¯t answer all these calls and do all
the filing.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Reuben Massey¡¯s master plan to deal with his
company¡¯s latest drug mess had been upended by the death of Senator Kirk
Maxwell, who was now derisively known in the Varrick hallways as Jerk Maxwell.
His widow had not filed suit, but her windbag of a lawyer was thoroughly
savoring his fifteen minutes in the spotlight. He was readily available for
interviews, even got himself on a few of the cable yak fests. He colored his
hair, bought some new suits, and was living the dream of so many lawyers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Varrick¡¯s common
stock had dipped to $29.50, its lowest price in six years. Two Wall Street
analysts, two men loathed by Massey, had issued sell recommendations. One
wrote: ¡°After only six years on the market, Krayoxx accounts for one-quarter of
Varrick¡¯s revenue. With it off the market, the company¡¯s near-term forecast is
quite uncertain.¡± The other wrote: ¡°The numbers are frightening. With one
million potential Krayoxx plaintiffs, Varrick will be mired in the cesspool of
mass tort litigation for the next ten years.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At least he got the
word ¡°cesspool¡± right, Massey mumbled to himself as he flipped through the
morning financials. It was not yet 8:00 a.m. The sky over Montville was cloudy,
the mood inside his bunker was somber, but, oddly, he was in good spirits. At
least once a week, and more often if possible, Mr. Massey allowed himself the
pleasure of eating someone for breakfast. Today¡¯s meal would be especially
delightful.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page194></a><span
lang=EN>As a young man Layton Koane had served four terms in the U.S. House
before he was called home by the voters after a messy affair with a female
staffer. Disgraced, he was unable to find meaningful work back home in
Tennessee, and as a college dropout he possessed no real talents or skills. His
r&eacute;sum&eacute; was embarrassingly thin. Divorced, unemployed, bankrupt, and only forty
years old, he drifted back to the Capitol and decided to venture down the
yellow brick road traveled by so many washed-up politicians. He embraced one of
Washington¡¯s time-honored traditions. He became a lobbyist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Unburdened by
ethical considerations, Koane quickly became a rising star in the game of pork.
He could find it, smell it, dig it out, and deliver it to clients willing to
pay his constantly rising fees. He was one of the first lobbyists to understand
the intricacies of earmarks, those addictive little dishes of lard so craved by
members of Congress and paid for by unwitting factory workers back home. Koane
first got noticed in his new trade when he collected a $100,000 fee from a
well-known public university in need of a new basketball arena. Uncle Sam pitched
in $10 million for the project, an appropriation found in the fine print of a
three-thousand-page bill passed at midnight. When a rival school heard about
it, a brouhaha ensued. But it was too late.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The controversy put
Koane on the map, and other clients came running. One was a real estate
developer in Virginia who envisioned the damming of a river, thus creating a
lake, thus allowing lakefront lots to be sold at hefty prices. Koane charged
the developer $500,000 and instructed him to drop another $100,000 into the PAC
of the congressman who represented the district where the dam was not needed.
Once everyone was paid and on board, Koane went to work on the federal budget
and found some spare change&#8212;$8 million&#8212;in a defense appropriation to the Army Corps
of Engineers. The dam was built. The developer made a bundle. Everyone was
happy but the environmentalists, conservationists, and the communities
downstream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page195></a><span
lang=EN>This was business as usual in Washington and would have gone unnoticed
but for a persistent reporter from Roanoke. Embarrassment and black eyes all
around&#8212;the congressman, the developer, Koane&#8212;but in the lobbying trade there is
no shame, and all publicity is good. Koane¡¯s business soared. After five years
in the game, he opened his own shop&#8212;The Koane Group, Specialists in
Governmental Affairs. After ten years, he was a multimillionaire. After twenty,
he was annually ranked as one of the three most powerful lobbyists in
Washington. (Does any other democracy rank its lobbyists?)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Varrick paid The
Koane Group a flat retainer of $1 million per year, and much more when actual
work was done. For that kind of money, Mr. Layton Koane would come running when
his client said so.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As
witnesses to the bloodbath, Reuben Massey decided to use his most trusted lawyers&#8212;Nicholas
Walker and Judy Beck. The three were in place when Koane arrived, alone, as per
Massey¡¯s instructions. Koane now owned a jet, had a chauffeur, and liked to
travel with an entourage, but not today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Things got off to a
cordial start as they exchanged pleasantries and nibbled on croissants. Koane
had gained even more weight, and his tailored suit was pulling at the seams. It
was shiny gray, with a sheen similar to that usually seen on suits worn by
television evangelists. His well-starched white shirt was bulging around the
waist. His fleshy triple neck was straining under his collar. As always, he
wore an orange tie and orange pocket square. Regardless of his wealth, he had
never learned how to dress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Massey loathed
Layton Koane and viewed him as a rube, a dope, a hack, a huckster who was lucky
enough to be in the right place at the right time. But then, Massey loathed
almost everything about Washington: the federal government and its stifling
regulations; the horde of staffers who wrote them; the politicians who approved
them; the bureaucrats who enforced them. To survive in such a dysfunctional
place, he figured, one had to be as greasy as Layton Koane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page196></a><span
lang=EN>¡°We¡¯re getting hammered in Washington,¡± Massey said, stating the
obvious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not just
Washington,¡± Koane replied with his twang. ¡°I own forty thousand shares of your
stock, remember?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>True, Varrick Labs
had once paid The Koane Group with stock options.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Massey picked up
some notes and peered over his reading glasses. ¡°Last year we paid your company
over $3 million.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Three million
two,¡± Koane said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And we contributed
the maximum amount to either the reelection campaign or the PAC of eighty-eight
out of a hundred members of the U.S. Senate, including, of course, the late
great Maxwell, may he rest in peace. We maxed out to over three hundred members
of the House. In both houses, we maxed out to both parties¡¯ central slush
funds, whatever the hell they¡¯re called. We maxed out to no fewer than forty
PACs, all supposedly doing God¡¯s work down there. In addition, two dozen of our
senior executives did their own version of maxing out, all under your guidance.
And now, thanks to the wisdom of the Supreme Court, we are able to funnel into
the electoral system vast sums of cash that cannot be detected. Over $5 million
last year alone. If you tally all this up, and you include all payments of all
types, reported and unreported, above the table and below, Varrick Laboratories
and its executives forked over almost $40 million last year to keep our great
democracy on the right track.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Massey dropped the
papers and glared at Koane. ¡°Forty million to buy one thing, Layton, the one
and only product you have to sell. Influence.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Koane was nodding
slowly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So please tell us,
Layton, with all this influence that we¡¯ve purchased over the years, how in
hell does the FDA pull Krayoxx off the market?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The FDA is the
FDA,¡± Koane replied. ¡°It¡¯s a world of its own, immune from political pressure,
or so we¡¯re led to believe.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page197></a><span
lang=EN>¡°Political pressure? Everything was fine until a politician died. It
looks to me like his buddies in the Senate pressured the hell out of the FDA.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Of course they
did.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Then where were
you? Don¡¯t you have former FDA commissioners on your payroll?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We have one, but
the important word is ¡®former.¡¯ He no longer gets a vote.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So, it appears to
me as if you got outpoliticked.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Perhaps for now,
Reuben. We¡¯ve lost the first battle, but we can still win the war. Maxwell¡¯s
gone and he¡¯s being forgotten by the minute. That¡¯s what happens in
Washington&#8212;they forget about you real fast. They¡¯re already campaigning in
Idaho to replace him. Give it some time and his death will be forgotten.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Time? We¡¯re losing
$18 million a day in sales because of the FDA. Since you arrived here this
morning and parked your car, we¡¯ve lost $400,000 in sales. Don¡¯t talk to me
about time, Layton.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nicholas Walker and
Judy Beck were, of course, taking notes. Or at least scribbling something on
their yellow legal pads. Neither looked up, but both were enjoying this little
workout.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Are you blaming
me, Reuben?¡± Koane asked, almost desperately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes. Absolutely. I
don¡¯t understand how that rotten place works down there, so I hire and pay you
a bloody fortune to guide my company through the minefield. So, yes, Layton,
when something goes wrong, I blame you. A perfectly safe drug has been yanked
off the market for no valid reason. Explain that to me, can you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I can¡¯t explain
it, but it¡¯s not fair to blame me. We¡¯ve been on top of this matter since the
first lawsuits were filed. We had solid contacts up and down the line, and the
FDA showed little interest in pulling the drug, regardless of how loud the
trial lawyers were screaming. We were safe. And then Maxwell collapsed in fine
fashion, on video. That changed everything.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There was a pause
as all four reached for their coffee cups.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page198></a><span
lang=EN>Koane never failed to bring along some gossip, some inside knowledge
that was passed along in whispers, and he couldn¡¯t wait to share it. ¡°A source
tells me the Maxwell family does not want to file a lawsuit. A very good
source.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who?¡± Massey
demanded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Another member of
the club, another senator who¡¯s very close to Maxwell and his family. He called
me yesterday. We had a drink. Sherry Maxwell does not want a lawsuit, but her
lawyer does. He¡¯s pretty shrewd, realizes he¡¯s got Varrick in his crosshairs.
If the lawsuit is filed, it¡¯s another round of bad news for the company, more
pressure on the FDA to keep the drug off the market. But if the lawsuit goes
away, then Maxwell will soon be forgotten. One headache down, more to follow.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Massey flipped his
right hand in circles. ¡°Keep going. Spill it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°For $5 million,
the lawsuit will go away. I¡¯ll handle it through my office. It will be a

what? For a drug that did no harm?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No. Five million
to soothe a big headache,¡± Koane replied. ¡°He was a senator for almost thirty
years, an honest one, so his estate is not too impressive. The family needs a
little cash.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Any news of a
settlement will trigger an avalanche with the tort boys,¡± Nicholas Walker said.
¡°You can¡¯t keep this quiet. There are too many reporters watching.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I know how to
manipulate the press, Nick. We shake hands on a deal now, sign the papers
behind locked doors, and wait it out. The Maxwell family and their lawyer will
have no comment, but I¡¯ll make sure there¡¯s a nice leak to the effect that the
family has chosen not to file suit. Look, there¡¯s no law, not even in this
country, that they have to sue. People walk away from lawsuits all the time for
all sorts of reasons. We cut the deal, sign the papers, promise them the money
in two years, plus interest. I can sell it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Massey stood and
stretched his back. He walked to a tall window and surveyed the fog and mist
seeping through the woods. Without turning around, he said, ¡°What do you think,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page199></a><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Agreed,¡± she said

returned to his seat, cracked his knuckles, rubbed his face, sipped his coffee,
obviously a man in deep thought. But he was anything but indecisive. ¡°Okay,
Layton, do the deal. Get rid of Maxwell. But if this settlement blows up in our

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Massey¡¯s eyes were

When he had their attention, he said, ¡°I suppose we should discuss our
settlement strategy. What¡¯s the timeline now?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The Chicago trial
is on track,¡± Walker said. ¡°There is no trial date, but we should hear
something soon. Nadine Karros is watching Judge Seawright¡¯s calendar, and
there¡¯s a nice gap in late October. With some luck, it might happen then.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s less than a
year after the lawsuit was filed.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, but we¡¯ve
done nothing to slow it down. Nadine¡¯s putting up a stiff defense, going
through all the motions, but no real obstacles. No motion to dismiss. No plans
for summary judgment. Discovery is proceeding nicely. Seawright seems to be
curious about the case and wants a trial.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Today is June 3.
They¡¯re still filing lawsuits. If we start talking settlement now, can we
string it out until October?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judy Beck
responded. ¡°No problem at all. Fetazine took three years to settle, and there
were half a million claims. Zoltaven took even <a name=page201></a>longer. The
tort bar is thinking about one thing&#8212;the $5 billion we charged off last
quarter. They¡¯re dreaming of that much money hitting the table.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It will be another
frenzy,¡± Nick said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Let¡¯s get it
started,¡± Massey said.</span></p>

CHAPTER_26'><span lang=EN>CHAPTER 26</span></span></h1>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Wally was sitting in divorce court on the
sixteenth floor of the Richard J. Daley Center, downtown. On tap for the
morning was <span class=0Text>Strate v. Strate</span>, one of a dozen or so
miserable little divorces that would forever (hopefully) separate two people
who had no business getting married in the first place. To untangle things,
they had hired Wally, paid him $750 in full for an uncontested divorce, and
after six months were now in court, on opposite sides of the aisle, anxious for
their case to be called. Wally waited too, waited and watched the procession of
scarred and warring spouses trek meekly to the bench, bow at the judge, speak
when their lawyers told them to, avoid eye contact with each other, and after a
few somber minutes leave, unmarried again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was in a
group of lawyers, all waiting impatiently. He knew about half of them. The
other half he¡¯d never seen before. In a city with twenty thousand lawyers, the
faces were always changing. What a rat race. What a grinding treadmill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A wife was crying
in front of the judge. She didn¡¯t want the divorce. Her husband did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally could not
wait until these scenes were history. One day soon he would spend his time in a
swanky office closer to downtown, far away from the sweat and stress of street
law, behind a wide marble desk with two shapely secretaries answering his
phones and fetching his files and a paralegal or two doing his grunt work. No
more divorces, DUIs, wills, cheap estates, no more clients who couldn¡¯t pay. He
would pick <a name=page203></a>and choose the injury cases he wanted and make
big money in the process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The other lawyers
were watching him warily. He knew this. They mentioned Krayoxx from time to
time. Curious, envious, some hoping Wally would strike gold because that would
give them hope. Others, though, were eager to see him fall flat because that
would prove their drudgery was what they were meant to do. Nothing more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>His cell phone
vibrated in his coat pocket. He grabbed it, focused on the name and number of
the caller, then jumped from his seat and sprinted from the courtroom. As soon
as he cleared the doors, he said, ¡°Jerry. I¡¯m in court. What¡¯s up?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Big news, Brother
Wally,¡± Alisandros sang. ¡°I played eighteen holes of golf yesterday with
Nicholas Walker. Ring a bell?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, yes. I¡¯m not
sure. Who?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We played on my
course. I shot a 78. Poor Nick was 20 strokes back. Not much of a golfer, I¡¯m
afraid. He¡¯s the chief in-house lawyer for Varrick Labs. Known him for years.
Prince of an asshole, but honorable.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There was a gap
Wally needed to fill here, but he could think of nothing helpful. ¡°So, Jerry,
you didn¡¯t call to brag about your golf game, right?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, Wally. I¡¯m
calling to inform you that Varrick wants to open a dialogue on the issue of
settlement. Not actual negotiations, mind you, but they want to start talking.
This is the way it usually happens. They crack the door. We get a foot in. They
tap-dance. We tap-dance. And before you know it, we¡¯re talking money. Big
money. Are you with me, Wally?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh yes.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I thought so.
Look, Wally, we have a long way to go before your cases are in a posture to be
settled. Let¡¯s get to work. I¡¯ll line up the doctors to do the exams&#8212;that¡¯s the
crucial part. You need to jack up your efforts to find more cases. We¡¯ll
probably settle the death cases first&#8212;how many do you have now?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Eight.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page204></a><span
lang=EN>¡°Is that all? Thought it was more.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s eight, Jerry,
with one on the fast track, remember? Klopeck.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Right, right. With
that hot chick on the other side. Frankly, I¡¯d like to try that one just to
stare at her legs all day.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Anyway.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Anyway, let¡¯s kick
into high gear. I¡¯ll call later this afternoon with a game plan. Lots of work
to do, Wally, but the fix is in.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally returned to
the courtroom and resumed his wait. He kept repeating, ¡°The fix is in. The fix
is in.¡± Game¡¯s up. Party¡¯s over. He¡¯d heard it all his life, but what did it
mean in the context of high-powered litigation? Was Varrick throwing in the
towel, surrendering so quickly, cutting its losses? Wally assumed so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He glanced at the
haggard, beaten-down lawyers around him. Ham-and-eggers just like himself who
spent their days trying to squeeze fees out of working stiffs with no money to
spare. You poor bastards, he thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He couldn¡¯t wait to
tell DeeAnna, but first he had to talk to Oscar. And not at Finley &amp; Figg,
where no conversation was ever private.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They
met for lunch two hours later at a spaghetti house not far from the office.
Oscar had had a rough morning trying to referee six grown children fighting
over their dead mother¡¯s estate, in which there was virtually nothing of value.
He needed a drink and ordered a bottle of inexpensive wine. Wally, at 241 days
sober, had no trouble sticking with water. Over Caprese salads, Wally quickly
recapped his conversation with Jerry Alisandros and ended with a dramatic ¡°This
is the moment, Oscar. It¡¯s finally going to happen.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar¡¯s mood
changed as he listened and gulped down the first glass. He managed a smile, and
Wally could almost see the skepticism evaporating. He took out a pen, shoved
the salad aside, and began scratching. ¡°Let¡¯s run through the math again,
Wally. Is a death case really worth $2 million?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally glanced
around to make sure no one was listening. The coast <a name=page205></a>was
clear. ¡°I¡¯ve done a ton of research, okay? I¡¯ve looked at dozens of settlements
in mass tort drug cases. There are too many unknowns right now to predict how
much each case is worth. You gotta determine liability, cause of death, medical
history, age of the deceased, income-earning potential, stuff like that. Then
we gotta find out how much Varrick is tossing in the pot. But a million bucks
is the floor, I think. We have eight. Fees are at 40 percent. Half to Jerry,
plus a stroke for his expertise, and we¡¯re looking at a net to our firm of
something like $1.5 mill.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar was
scribbling with a fury, though he¡¯d heard these numbers a hundred times.
¡°They¡¯re death cases. They gotta be worth more than a mill each,¡± he said, as
if he¡¯d handled dozens of these large cases.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Maybe two,¡± Wally
said. ¡°Then we got all the non-death cases, 407 as of now. Let¡¯s say only half
can qualify after a medical exam. Based on somewhat similar cases&#8212;the mass drug
variety&#8212;I think $100,000 is a reasonable figure for a client whose heart valve
has been slightly damaged. That¡¯s $20 million, Oscar. Our cut is something in
the neighborhood of $3.5 million.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar wrote
something, then stopped, took a long drink of wine, and said, ¡°So, we should
talk about our split, right? Is that where this is going?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The split is one
of several pressing issues.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Okay, what¡¯s wrong
with fifty-fifty?¡± All fee fights began with an even split.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally stuffed a
slice of tomato into his mouth and chewed it fiercely. ¡°What¡¯s wrong with
fifty-fifty is that I discovered Krayoxx, rounded up the cases, and so far I¡¯ve
done about 90 percent of the work. I have the eight death cases in my office.
David has the other four hundred upstairs. You, if I¡¯m not mistaken, have no
Krayoxx cases in your office.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re not asking
for 90 percent are you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Of course not.
Here¡¯s my suggestion. We have a ton of work to do. All of these cases have to
be screened by a doctor, evaluated, and so on. Let¡¯s put everything else
aside&#8212;me, you, David&#8212;and get to <a name=page206></a>work. We prep the cases
while we¡¯re also looking for new ones. Once the settlement news breaks, every
lawyer in the country will go crazy over Krayoxx, so we gotta get even busier.
And once the checks arrive, I think a sixty-thirty-ten split is fair.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar had ordered
the lasagna special, and Wally the stuffed ravioli. When the waiter was gone,
Oscar said, ¡°Your fee is twice mine? That¡¯s never happened before. I don¡¯t like
it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What do you like?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Fifty-fifty.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And what about
David? We promised him a cut when he agreed to take the non-death cases.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Okay, fifty for
you, forty for me, ten for David. Rochelle gets a nice bonus but no piece of
the pie.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With so much money
on the way, it was easy to toss around the numbers, even easier to cut a deal.
There had been nasty fights over $5,000 fees, but not today. The money soothed
them and took away any desire to squabble. Wally slowly reached across, and
Oscar did the same. They quickly shook hands and plunged into their entr&eacute;es.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After a few bites,
Wally said, ¡°How¡¯s the wife?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar frowned,
grimaced, and looked away. Paula Finley was a subject completely off-limits
because no one at the firm could stand her, including Oscar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally pressed on.
¡°You know, Oscar, this is the moment. If you¡¯re ever going to ditch her, do it
now.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Marital advice
from you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, because you
know I¡¯m right.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I assume you¡¯ve
been thinking about this.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, because you
have not, and that¡¯s because you¡¯ve never believed in these cases, until now
perhaps.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar poured more
wine and said, ¡°Let¡¯s hear it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally leaned in
closer again, as if they were swapping nuclear secrets. ¡°File for divorce now,
immediately. No big deal. I¡¯ve done it four times. Move out, get an apartment,
cut all ties. I¡¯ll handle it on your end, and she can hire whomever she wants.
We¡¯ll draw up a contract, <a name=page207></a>date it six months ago, and it¡¯ll
say that I get 80 percent of the Krayoxx settlements, if any, and you and David
split 20 percent. You gotta show some income from Krayoxx; otherwise her lawyer
will go nuts. But most of the money can stay in a slush fund for, I don¡¯t know,
a year or so, until the divorce is over. Then, at some unknown point in the
future, you and I settle up.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s a
fraudulent transfer of assets.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I know. I love it.
I¡¯ve done it a thousand times, though on a much smaller scale. I suspect you
have too. Pretty clever, don¡¯t you think?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°If we get caught,
we could both get thrown in jail for contempt of court, with no hearing.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We will not get
caught. She thinks Krayoxx is all mine, right?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Right.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So, it¡¯ll work.
It¡¯s our law firm, and we make the rules on how the money gets split.
Completely within our discretion.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Her lawyers won¡¯t
be stupid, Wally. They¡¯ll know all about the big Krayoxx settlement as soon as
it happens.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Come on, Oscar, it
ain¡¯t like we hit these licks all the time. Over the last ten years I suspect
your adjusted gross has averaged, what, $75,000?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar shrugged.
¡°About the same as yours. Pretty pathetic, don¡¯t you think? Thirty years in the
trenches.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not the point,
Oscar. The point is that in a divorce, they¡¯ll look at what you¡¯ve earned in
the past.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I know.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°If the Krayoxx
money is mine, then we can argue, with evidence, that your income hasn¡¯t
changed.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What will you do
with the money?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Bury it offshore
until the divorce is over. Hell, Oscar, we could leave it offshore and pop down
to Grand Cayman once a year to check on it. Believe me, there¡¯s no way they¡¯ll
ever know. But you gotta file now and get out.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Why are you so
keen on me getting a divorce?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Because I loathe
that woman. Because you¡¯ve been dreaming of a <a name=page208></a>divorce since
your honeymoon. Because you deserve to be happy, and if you sack this bitch and
hide the money, your life will take a dramatic turn for the better. Think of
it, Oscar, single at sixty-two with cash in the bank.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar couldn¡¯t
suppress a smile. He drained his third glass. He took a few bites. He was
obviously struggling with something, so he finally asked, ¡°How do I break it to
her?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally dabbed the
corners of his mouth, stiffened his spine, and assumed the voice of authority.
¡°Well, there are many ways to do it, and I¡¯ve tried them all. Have you two ever
talked about splitting up?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not that I
recall.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I assume it would
be easy to start a big fight.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh, so easy. She¡¯s
always unhappy about something, usually money, and we fight almost every day.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s what I
figured. Do it like this, Oscar. Go home tonight and drop the bomb. Tell her
you¡¯re unhappy and you want out. Plain and simple. No fighting, no bickering,

can have it all if she¡¯ll agree to a no-fault.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And if she won¡¯t
agree?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Leave anyway. Come

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She¡¯s already a
cobra.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And she has been

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oscar, sometimes
it takes balls to walk away. Do it now while you can still enjoy life.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar poured the
last of the wine into his glass and started smiling again. Wally could not
remember the last time he¡¯d seen his senior partner so content.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page209></a><span

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>It had been difficult to convince the Khaing
family that they sincerely wanted to help, but after a few weeks of Big Mac
dinners a high level of trust developed. Each Wednesday, after an early dinner
of something healthier, David and Helen pulled through the same McDonald¡¯s,
ordered the same burgers and fries, and drove to the apartment complex in
Rogers Park to visit the family. Zaw, the grandmother, and Lu, the grandfather,
joined in because they were also fond of fast food. For the rest of the week
they lived on a diet that was primarily rice and chicken, but on Wednesday the
Khaings ate like real Americans.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Helen, seven months

visits. If there was lead in the air, she had an unborn baby to protect. So
David checked everything. He badgered Dr. Biff Sandroni until he cut his fee
from $20,000 to $5,000, with David doing most of the legwork. David went
through the apartment himself and collected samples of wall paint, water,
ceramic coatings, cups and saucers, plates, mixing bowls, family photo albums,
toys, shoes, clothing, virtually anything and everything the family came into
contact with. He drove this collection to Sandroni¡¯s lab in Akron, dropped it
off, then picked it up two weeks later and returned it to the family. According
to Sandroni¡¯s report, there were only traces of lead, acceptable levels and
nothing for the family to worry about. Helen and the baby were safe in the
Khaing apartment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Thuya had been
poisoned by the Nasty Teeth, and Dr. Sandroni <a name=page211></a>was prepared
to say so, under oath, in any court in the country. David was sitting on a
promising lawsuit, but they had yet to find a defendant. He and Sandroni had a
short list of four Chinese companies known to make similar toys for American
importers, but they had not been able to pinpoint the manufacturer. And,
according to Sandroni, there was a good chance they would never identify it.
The set of Nasty Teeth could have been made twenty years earlier, then stored
in a warehouse for a decade before being shipped to the U.S., where it could
have spent another five years languishing in the supply chain. The manufacturer
and the importer could still be in business, or they might have gone bust years
ago. The Chinese were under constant pressure from U.S. watchdogs to monitor
the amount of lead used in a thousand products, and it was often impossible to
determine who made what in the maze of cheap factories scattered around the
country. Dr. Sandroni had an endless list of sources, he¡¯d been involved in
hundreds of lawsuits, but after four months of digging, he was empty-handed.
David and Helen had been to every flea market and toy store in Greater Chicago,
and they had put together an astonishing collection of fake teeth and vampire
fangs, but nothing exactly like Nasty Teeth. Their search wasn¡¯t over, but it
had lost steam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Thuya was home now,
alive but grievously wounded. The brain damage was severe. He could not walk
without assistance, speak clearly, feed himself, or control his bodily
functions. His vision was limited, and he could barely respond to basic
commands. Ask him his name and he would open his mouth and emit a sound similar
to ¡°Tay.¡± He spent most of his time in a special bed with guardrails, and
keeping it clean was a difficult task. Caring for the boy was a daily struggle
that involved everyone in the family and many of the neighbors. The future was
beyond contemplation. His condition was not likely to improve, according to the
rather tactful statements of his doctors. Off the record and away from the
family, they told David in confidence that Thuya¡¯s body and mind would not grow
normally, and there was nothing else they could do. And there was no place to
put him&#8212;no facility for brain-damaged children.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page212></a><span
lang=EN>Thuya was spoon-fed a special formula that was a mix of finely ground
fruit and vegetables and loaded with daily nutrients. He wore diapers made
especially for such children. The formula, diapers, and medications were
running $600 a month, of which David and Helen had pledged half. The Khaings
had no health insurance, and had it not been for the generosity of the
Lakeshore Children¡¯s Hospital he would not have received such high-quality
care. He would probably be dead. In short, Thuya was now a burden that was
almost inconceivable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Soe and Lwin
insisted that he sit at the table for dinner. He had a special chair, also
donated by the hospital, and when properly belted and latched down, he sat
straight and expected his food. While the family devoured the burgers and
fries, Helen carefully fed Thuya with a baby spoon. She said she needed the
practice. David sat on the other side with a paper towel, chatting with Soe
about work and life in America. Thuya¡¯s sisters, who chose to use the American
names of Lynn and Erin, were eight and six, respectively. They said little
during dinner, but it was obvious they were thrilled with real fast food. When
they did speak, it was with perfect, unaccented English. According to Lwin,
they were making straight A¡¯s in school.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Perhaps it was the
gloomy prospect of an uncertain future, or maybe it was just the meager
existence being carved out by desperate immigrants, but the dinners were solemn
and subdued. At various times, the parents, grandparents, and sisters looked at
Thuya as if they wanted to cry. They remembered the noisy, hyper little boy
with the quick smile and easy laugh, and they were struggling to accept the
truth that he would never return. Soe blamed himself for buying the fake teeth.
Lwin blamed herself for not being more diligent. Lynn and Erin blamed
themselves for encouraging Thuya to play with the teeth and scare them. Even
Zaw and Lu blamed themselves; they should have done something, though they had
no idea what.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After dinner, David
and Helen walked Thuya out of the apartment, down the short sidewalk, and, with
the entire family watching, strapped him into the rear seat of their car and
drove away. For emergencies, <a name=page213></a>they brought along a small bag
with extra diapers and cleaning supplies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They drove twenty
minutes to the lakefront and parked near Navy Pier. David took his left hand,
Helen his right, and they began a slow, plodding walk that was almost painful
to watch. Thuya moved like a ten-month-old attempting his first steps, but
there was no hurry and he wasn¡¯t about to fall. They eased along the boardwalk,
passing all kinds of boats. If Thuya wanted to stop and inspect a forty-foot
ketch, they did so. If he wanted to look at a large fishing boat, they stopped
and talked about it. David and Helen chattered nonstop, like two proud parents
with a toddler. Thuya jabbered back, an incomprehensible stream of utterings
and noises that they pretended to understand. When he grew tired, they pushed
him to keep walking. It was important, according to the rehab specialist at the
hospital. His muscles could not get soft.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They had taken him
to parks, carnivals, malls, ball games, and street parties. The Wednesday night
excursions were important to him, and the only break during the week for his
family. After two hours, they returned to the apartment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Three new faces
were waiting. In the past months, David had handled several minor legal matters
for the Burmese who lived in the complex. There were the usual immigration
matters, and he was becoming adept in that growing specialty of the law. There
had been a near divorce, but the spouses reconciled. There was an ongoing
lawsuit over the purchase of a used car. His reputation was growing among the
Burmese immigrants, and he was not convinced that was altogether a good thing.
He needed clients who could pay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They stepped
outside and leaned on the cars. Soe explained that the three men were working
for a drainage contractor. Because they were illegals, and the contractor knew
this, he was paying them $200 a week in cash. They were working eighty hours a
week. To make matters worse, their boss had not paid them a dime in three
weeks. They spoke little English, and because David could not believe what he
was hearing, he asked Soe to carefully go through it a second time. <a
name=page214></a>This version was the same as the first. Two hundred dollars a
week, straight pay for overtime, no pay in three weeks. And they were not the
only ones. There were others from Burma and a whole truckload from Mexico. All
illegals, all working like dogs, all getting screwed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David took notes
and promised to look into the situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Driving home, he
described the case to Helen. ¡°But does an illegal worker have the right to sue
a crooked employer?¡± she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s the
question. I¡¯ll find out tomorrow.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After
lunch, Oscar did not return to the office. To do so would have been fruitless.
He had far too much on his mind to waste time puttering around his desk. He was
half drunk, and he needed to sober up. He filled his tank at a convenience
store, bought a tall cup of black coffee, then headed south on I-57 and was
soon outside of Chicago and passing through farmland.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>How many times had
he advised his clients to file for divorce? Thousands. It was so easy to do,
under the circumstances. ¡°Look, there comes a time in some marriages when a
spouse needs to get out. For you, that time is now.¡± He¡¯d always felt so wise,
even smug when dispensing such advice. Now he felt like a fraud. How could a
person give such counsel unless he¡¯d been through it himself?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He and Paula had
been together for thirty unhappy years. Their only child was a
twenty-six-year-old divorc&eacute;e named Keely who was becoming more and more like
her mother. Keely¡¯s divorce was still fresh, primarily because she enjoyed
reveling in her misery. She had a job that paid little, lots of contrived
emotional problems that required pills, and her principal source of therapy was
nonstop shopping with her mother at Oscar¡¯s expense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m sick of both
of them,¡± Oscar said loudly and boldly as he passed the exit signs at Kankakee.
¡°I¡¯m sixty-two years old, in good health, with a life expectancy now of
twenty-three more years, and I have the right to pursue happiness. Right?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Of course he did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page215></a><span
lang=EN>But how to break the news? That was the question. What should he say to
drop the bomb? He thought of old clients, old divorces he¡¯d handled over the
years. At the extreme end of the spectrum, the bomb was dropped when the wife
caught the husband in bed with another woman. Oscar could think of three, maybe
four cases where this had happened. That was a bomb dropper all right. The
marriage is over, honey, I¡¯ve found someone else. At the other end, he¡¯d once
handled a divorce for a couple who never fought, never discussed separation or
divorce, and had just celebrated their thirtieth wedding anniversary and
purchased a retirement home on a lake. Then the husband came home from a
business trip and the house was deserted. All of his wife¡¯s clothes and half
the furnishings were gone. She moved out, said she had never loved him. She
soon remarried, and he killed himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was never
difficult provoking a fight with Paula; the woman loved to bicker and brawl.
Perhaps he should drink some more, go home half drunk, get her started on his
drinking, push back hard with her endless shopping, keep throwing gas on the
fire until they were both screaming. He could then pack some clothes in a huff
and storm out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar had never
found the courage to walk out. He should have, dozens of times, but he always
slunk down the hall, went to the guest bedroom, locked the door, and slept
alone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As he approached
Champaign, he settled on his plan. Why go through the ruse of starting a fight
so he could pin blame on her? He wanted out, so be a man and admit it. ¡°I¡¯m
unhappy, Paula, and I¡¯ve been unhappy for years. There¡¯s no doubt you¡¯re
unhappy too; otherwise you wouldn¡¯t bitch and quarrel all the time. I¡¯m
leaving. You can have the house and everything in it. I¡¯m taking my clothes.
Goodbye.¡± He turned around and headed north.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ultimately,
it was quite simple, and Paula took it well enough. She cried a little, and
called him a few names, but when Oscar refused to take the bait, she locked
herself in the basement and refused to come <a name=page216></a>out. Oscar
loaded his car with clothes and a few personal items, then sped away, smiling,
relieved, growing happier with each passing street.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Sixty-two, about to
be single for the first time in forever, about to be rich, if he could trust
Wally, which he did at the moment. In fact, he was placing an enormous amount
of trust in his junior partner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar wasn¡¯t sure
where he was going, but he wasn¡¯t about to stop by Wally¡¯s apartment and spend
the night. He saw enough of the guy at the office; besides, the bimbo was apt
to drop in, and Oscar couldn¡¯t stand her. He drove around for an hour, then
checked in to a hotel near O¡¯Hare. He pulled a chair to the window and watched
the takeoffs and landings in the distance. One day soon he would be jetting
here and there&#8212;islands, Paris, New Zealand&#8212;with a pleasant lady at his side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He felt twenty

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>At 7:30 the following morning, Rochelle arrived
nice and early with plans to enjoy her yogurt and newspaper with no one but AC
around, but AC was already playing with someone else. Mr. Finley was there and
quite chipper. Rochelle could not remember the last time he had arrived before
she did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good morning, Ms.

joy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Because I left

never going back.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Praise the Lord,¡±
she said, wide-eyed and wonder-struck. ¡°You didn¡¯t?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, I did. After
thirty miserable years, I¡¯m a free man. This is why I¡¯m so happy, Ms. Gibson.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, I¡¯m happy
too. Congratulations.¡± In her eight and a half <a name=page218></a>years at Finley
&amp; Figg, Rochelle had never met Paula Finley in person, and she was
delighted about this. According to Wally, Paula refused to set foot on the
property because it was beneath her dignity. She was quick to tell folks her
husband was a lawyer, with the requisite implications of money and power, but
was also secretly humiliated by the low standing of his firm. She spent every
dime he earned, and if not for some mysterious family money on her side, they
would have gone broke years earlier. On at least three occasions, she had
demanded that Oscar fire Rochelle, and he had tried twice. Twice he¡¯d limped
back to his office, locked the door, and licked his wounds. On one noted
occasion, Ms. Finley called and wanted to talk to her husband. Rochelle
politely informed her he was with a client. ¡°I don¡¯t care,¡± she said. ¡°Put me
through.¡± Rochelle declined again and instead put her on hold. When Rochelle
picked up again, Paula was cursing, near cardiac arrest, and threatened to
march right down there and straighten things out at the office. To which
Rochelle responded: ¡°Do so at your own risk. I live in the projects and I don¡¯t
scare too easy.¡± Paula Finley did not appear, but she did berate her husband.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle took a
step over and gave Oscar a firm hug. Neither could remember the last time they
had touched for any reason. ¡°You¡¯re gonna be a new man,¡± she said.
¡°Congratulations.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Should be a simple
divorce,¡± he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re not using
Figg, are you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, yes. He
works cheap. I saw his name on a bingo card.¡± They shared a laugh, then began
swapping gossip at the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>An hour later,
during the third firm meeting, Oscar repeated the news for the benefit of
David, who seemed a bit confused by the enthusiasm the news was generating. Not
a trace of sadness anywhere. It was obvious that Paula Finley had made plenty
of enemies. Oscar was almost giddy at the thought of shedding her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally summed up his
conversations with Jerry Alisandros and spun the news in such a way that it
seemed as though big checks were practically in the mail. As he rambled on,
David suddenly figured out the divorce. Unload the wife now, and quickly,
before serious money <a name=page219></a>rolled in. Whatever the scheme was,
David smelled trouble. Hiding assets, rerouting funds, setting up bogus bank
accounts&#8212;he could almost hear the conversations between the two partners.
Warning flags went up. David would be curious and vigilant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally exhorted the
firm to kick into high gear, to get the files in order, find new cases, set
aside everything else, and so on. Alisandros promised to provide medical
screeners, cardiologists, all manner of logistical support to prepare his
clients for the settlement. Every current case was worth serious cash; every
prospective case could be worth even more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar just sat
there and grinned. Rochelle listened intently. David found the news exciting,
but he was also cautious. So much of what Wally said was hyperbole, and David
had learned to cut it in half. Still, half would be a wonderful payday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The Zinc family
balance sheet had dipped under $100,000 in buried cash, and while David refused
to worry, he was thinking about it more and more. He¡¯d paid Sandroni $7,500 for
a case that was probably worthless. He and Helen had committed $300 a month to
Thuya¡¯s support, which would hopefully go on for years. They had not hesitated
to do this, but reality was setting in. His monthly gross from the firm was
rising steadily, though it was unlikely he would ever earn what he¡¯d made at
Rogan. That was not his benchmark. With a new child, he figured he needed
$125,000 a year to live comfortably. Krayoxx just might shore up the balance
sheet, though he and the two partners had not discussed his slice of the pie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The third firm
meeting ended abruptly when a woman the size of a linebacker, in sweats and flip-flops,
barged through the front door and demanded to speak to a lawyer about Krayoxx.
She had taken it for two years, could actually feel her heart getting weaker,
and wanted to sue the company that very day. Oscar and David vanished. Wally
welcomed her with a smile and said, ¡°Well, you¡¯ve certainly come to the right
place.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page220></a><span
lang=EN>The family of Senator Maxwell hired a Boise trial lawyer by the name of
Frazier Gant, the number one man in a mildly successful firm that handled
mostly tractor-trailer accidents and medical malpractice. Boise is not exactly
on the big-verdict circuit. It rarely sees the liberal awards common in
Florida, Texas, New York, and California. Idaho frowns on tort litigation, and
juries there are generally conservative. But Gant could put together a case and
get a verdict. He was someone to reckon with, and at the moment he happened to
have the biggest tort case in the country. A dead senator, stricken on the
Senate floor, and the cause of death pinned squarely on a huge corporation. It
was a trial lawyer¡¯s dream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gant insisted on
meeting in Washington, as opposed to Boise, though Layton Koane was perfectly
willing to meet anywhere. In fact, Koane preferred anywhere but Washington
because that would bring Gant into his office. The Koane Group leased the top
floor of a brand-new sleek, shiny ten-story building on K Street, that stretch
of asphalt packed with the real power brokers in Washington. Koane had paid a
fortune to a New York designer to project the image of pure wealth and prestige.
It worked. Clients&#8212;current and prospective&#8212;were awed by marble and glass the
moment they stepped off the private elevator. They were in the midst of power,
and they were certainly paying for it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With Gant, though,
the tables were turned. It was the lobbyist who would be handing over the
money, and he preferred a more low-key meeting place. But Gant insisted, and
some nine weeks after the senator¡¯s death, and, more important, at least to
Koane and Varrick, almost seven weeks after the FDA yanked Krayoxx, they
introduced themselves and settled around a small conference table at the far
end of Koane¡¯s personal office. Since he was not interested in impressing a
client, and he found this particular task distasteful, Koane didn¡¯t waste time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I have a source
who tells me the family will settle for five million without a lawsuit,¡± he
said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gant frowned, a
quick sharp grimace as if a hemorrhoid had twitched. ¡°We can negotiate,¡± he
said, a throwaway line that meant <a name=page221></a>nothing. He¡¯d flown in
from Boise to negotiate and nothing more. ¡°But I think five is on the low
side.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What¡¯s on the high
side?¡± Koane asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°My client doesn¡¯t
have a lot of money,¡± Gant said sadly. ¡°As you know, the senator devoted his
life to public service and sacrificed a lot. His estate is only half a million,
but the family has needs. Maxwell is a big name out in Idaho and the family
would like to maintain a certain lifestyle.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>One of Koane¡¯s
specialties was the shakedown, and he found it somewhat amusing to be on the
other end of one. The family consisted of a widow, a very nice, low-key woman
of sixty whose tastes were not expensive, a forty-year-old daughter who was
married to a Boise pediatrician and maxed out credit-wise on all fronts, a
thirty-five-year-old daughter who taught school for $41,000 a year, and a
thirty-one-year-old son who was the problem. Kirk Maxwell Jr. had been battling
drugs and alcohol since he was fifteen, and he was not winning. Koane had his
research, and he knew more about the family than Gant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Why don¡¯t you
suggest a figure?¡± he said. ¡°I mentioned five, now it¡¯s your turn.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Your client is
losing about twenty million a day in revenue because Krayoxx is no longer on
the market,¡± Gant said smartly, as if dealing in inside information he¡¯d
cleverly gathered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s more like
eighteen, but let¡¯s not nitpick.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Twenty has a nice
ring to it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Koane glared over
his reading glasses. His jaw dropped slightly. In this business nothing
surprised him, and he was faking it now. ¡°Twenty million bucks?¡± he repeated,
as if dumbfounded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gant gritted his
teeth and nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Koane recovered
quickly and said, ¡°Let me get this straight. Senator Maxwell was here for
thirty years, and during that time he received at least $3 million from Big
Pharma and its related PACs, much of it from the pockets of Varrick and its
executives, and he also took about $1 million from folks like the National Tort
Reform Initiative and other groups seeking to severely restrict lawsuits, bogus
and otherwise. He <a name=page222></a>took another $4 million from doctors,
hospitals, banks, manufacturers, retailers, a very long list of good-government
groups determined to cap damages, limit lawsuits, and basically slam the
courthouse door on anyone with a claim of injury or death. When it came to tort
reform and Big Pharma, the dear late senator had a perfect voting record. I
doubt if you ever supported him.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Occasionally,¡±
Gant said without conviction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, we couldn¡¯t
find any record of any contribution from you or your firm to any of his
campaigns. Face it, you guys were on opposite sides of the street.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Okay, why is that
relevant now?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s not.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Then why are we
discussing it? He, like every other member of the Senate, raised a lot of
money. It was all legal, and the money was always spent to get him reelected.
Surely you understand this game, Mr. Koane.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Indeed I do. So he
drops dead and now blames Krayoxx. Are you aware that he had stopped using the
drug? His last prescription was in October of last year, seven months before he
succumbed. His autopsy revealed significant heart disease, congestion,
blockage, none of which was caused by Krayoxx. You take this case to trial and
you¡¯ll get buried.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I doubt that, Mr.
Koane. You¡¯ve never seen me in the courtroom.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I have not.¡± But
Koane had the research. Gant¡¯s largest verdict was $2 million, half of which
was set aside on appeal. His previous year¡¯s IRS 1040 listed an adjusted gross
of just under $400,000. Chump change compared with the millions Koane raked in.
Gant was paying $5,000 in alimony and $11,000 a month on a highly mortgaged
golf course home that was underwater. The Maxwell case was, without a doubt,
his ship coming in. Koane did not know the specific terms of his contingency
fee, but according to a Boise source Gant would get 25 percent of a settlement
and 40 percent of a jury verdict.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gant leaned forward
on his elbows and said, ¡°You and I both know this case is not about liability,
and it¡¯s not really about damages. The <a name=page223></a>only real issue here
is how much Varrick is willing to pay to keep me from filing a big, splashy
lawsuit. Because if I do, then we keep the pressure on the FDA, don¡¯t we, Mr.
Koane?¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Koane
excused himself and went into another room. Reuben Massey was waiting in his
office at Varrick Labs. Nicholas Walker was also at the table. They were using
a speakerphone. ¡°They want $20 million,¡± Koane said, then braced for the
attack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But Massey received
the news without emotion. He believed in using his products and had just popped
a Plazid, his company¡¯s version of the daily happy pill. ¡°Wow, Koane,¡± he said
calmly. ¡°You¡¯re doing a helluva job at the negotiating table, old boy. Start at
five, now you¡¯re up to twenty. We¡¯d better grab the twenty before you get it up
to forty. What the hell¡¯s happening down there?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Nothing but greed,
Reuben. They know they have us over a barrel. This guy freely admits the
lawsuit is not about liability or damages. We can¡¯t take any more bad press, so
how much are we willing to pay to make Maxwell¡¯s case go away? It¡¯s that
simple.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I thought you had
some great source whispering in your ear to the tune of $5 million.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I thought so too.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°This is not
litigation. This is armed robbery.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, Reuben, I¡¯m
afraid so.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Layton, Nick here.
Have you countered?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No. My authority
was five. Until you say so, I cannot go higher.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Walker was smiling
as he spoke. ¡°This is the perfect time to walk away. This guy Gant is already
counting his money, several million, he thinks. I know the species, and they¡¯re
very predictable. Let¡¯s send him back to Idaho with empty pockets. He won¡¯t
know what hit him, neither will the family. Koane, tell him your limit is five
and the CEO is out of the country. We¡¯ll have to meet and discuss all of this,
which could take a few days. Warn him, though, that if he fires off a lawsuit,
then all settlement talk goes away.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page224></a><span
lang=EN>¡°He won¡¯t do that,¡± Koane said. ¡°I think you¡¯re right. I think he¡¯s
counting his money.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I like it,¡± Massey
said, ¡°but it would be nice to wrap this up. Go to seven, Layton, but that¡¯s
all.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Back
in his office, Koane settled into his chair and said, ¡°My authority is seven. I
can¡¯t go higher today and I can¡¯t get the CEO. I think he¡¯s traveling in Asia,
probably on a plane.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Seven is a long
way from twenty,¡± Gant replied with a frown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re not getting
twenty. I spoke with in-house counsel, who¡¯s also on the board.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Then we¡¯ll see you
in court,¡± Gant said, zipping up a thin briefcase he hadn¡¯t used.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s a pretty
lame threat, Mr. Gant. No jury in the country will give you $7 million for a
death that was caused by heart disease completely unrelated to our drug. And
the way we litigate, a trial is three years away. That¡¯s a long time to sit and
think about $7 million.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gant abruptly stood
and said, ¡°Thank you for your time, Mr. Koane. I¡¯ll see myself out.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°When you leave,
Mr. Gant, our offer of $7 million comes off the table. You go home with zero.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Gant
stutter-stepped slightly, then regained his stride. ¡°See you in court,¡± he
said, tight-lipped, and left through the door.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Two
hours later, Gant called on his cell. Seemed the Maxwell family had
reconsidered, came to its senses, at the prodding of their trusted lawyer, of
course, and, well, $7 million sounded pretty damn good after all. Layton Koane
carefully walked him through each issue at stake, and Gant was happily on board
with all of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After the call, Koane
relayed the news to Reuben Massey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I doubt if he ever

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And we¡¯ve dodged a

CHAPTER_29'><span lang=EN>CHAPTER 29</span></span></h1>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>In federal court, David filed a lawsuit alleging
all manner of fair labor violations by a shady drainage contractor called
Cicero Pipe. The job was a large water-treatment plant on the South Side, of
which the defendant had a $60 million piece. The plaintiffs were three
undocumented workers from Burma and two from Mexico. The violations covered
many more workers, but most refused to join the lawsuit. There was too much
fear of coming forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>According to
David¡¯s research, the Department of Labor (DOL) and the U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (ICE) had reached an uneasy truce regarding the
mistreatment of illegal immigrants. The steadfast principle of unhindered
access to justice overrode (slightly) the country¡¯s need to regulate
immigration. Therefore, an undocumented worker courageous enough to fight a
crooked employer would not be subjected to scrutiny by ICE, at least not while
engaged in the labor dispute. David explained this repeatedly to the workers,
and the Burmese, with Soe Khaing¡¯s prodding, eventually found the nerve to file
suit. Others, from Mexico and Guatemala, were too frightened by the idea of
risking what little money they were being paid. One of the Burmese workers
estimated there were at least thirty men, all of them thought to be
undocumented, being paid $200 a week in cash for eighty hours or more of hard
labor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The potential
damages were impressive. The minimum wage was $8.25, and federal law also
required $12.38 for any hour over forty per <a name=page227></a>week. For
eighty hours, each worker was due $825.20 per week, or $625.20 more than he was
being paid. Though exact dates were hard to pin down, David¡¯s best guess was
that the current scam by Cicero Pipe had been under way for at least thirty
weeks. The law allowed liquidated damages of twice the unpaid wages, so each of
his five clients was entitled to about $37,500. The law also allowed the judge
to impose court costs and attorneys¡¯ fees on a defendant found liable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar reluctantly
agreed to allow David to file the lawsuit. Wally could not be found. He was
burning up the streets looking for large people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Three days after
the lawsuit was filed, an anonymous caller threatened to cut David¡¯s throat if
the lawsuit was not dismissed immediately. David reported the call to the
police. Oscar advised him to purchase a handgun and keep it in his briefcase.
David refused. The following day, an anonymous letter threatened his life and
named his pals&#8212;Oscar Finley, Wally Figg, even Rochelle Gibson.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The
thug walked briskly along Preston as if hurrying home at such a late hour. It
was just after 2:00 a.m., the late July air still thick and warm. Male, white,
age thirty, an impressive rap sheet, and not much between the ears. Slung over
his shoulder was a cheap gym bag, and inside was a two-liter plastic jug of
gasoline, tightly sealed. He took a quick right and darted low onto the narrow
porch of the law office. All lights were off, inside and out. Preston was
asleep; even the massage parlor had finally wound down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>If AC had been
awake, he might have heard the slight rattle of the doorknob as the thug gently
checked to see if someone had forgotten to lock up. The lock had not been
forgotten. AC was asleep in the kitchen. Oscar, though, was awake on the sofa,
in his pajamas, under a quilt, thinking about how happy he¡¯d become since
moving out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The thug eased
along the front porch, stepped down, and scooted low around the building until
he came to the back door. His strategy was to get inside and detonate his crude
little bomb. Two liters of gasoline <a name=page228></a>on a wooden floor with
curtains and books nearby would gut the old house before a fire crew got there.
He shook the door&#8212;it too was locked&#8212;then quickly jimmied it with a screwdriver.
It swung open as he took one step inside. Everything was dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A dog growled, then
two extremely loud shots rang out. The thug screamed and fell off the back
steps into a small neglected flower bed. Oscar stood over him. A quick glance revealed
a wound just above his right knee.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Don¡¯t! Please!¡±
the thug begged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Carefully, coldly,
Oscar shot him in the other leg.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Two
hours later, Oscar, partially dressed now, was chatting with two policemen at
the table. All three were sipping coffee. The thug was at the hospital, in
surgery&#8212;two damaged legs but no chance of dying. His name was Justin Bardall,
and when he wasn¡¯t playing with fire and getting shot, he operated a bulldozer
for Cicero Pipe. ¡°Idiots, idiots, idiots,¡± Oscar kept saying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But he wasn¡¯t
supposed to get caught,¡± said one of the cops, laughing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At that moment, two
detectives were in Evanston knocking on the door of the man who owned Cicero
Pipe. It was the beginning of a long day for him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar explained
that he was going through a divorce and looking for an apartment. When he
wasn¡¯t at a hotel, he slept on the office sofa. ¡°I¡¯ve owned this place for
twenty-one years,¡± he said. He knew one of the cops and had seen the other one
around. Neither had the slightest concern over the shooting. It was a clear-cut
case of protecting one¡¯s property, though Oscar¡¯s narrative omitted the
unnecessary wounding of the second leg. In addition to the two-liter bottle of
gas, the gym bag contained a strip of cotton cloth doused with what appeared to
be kerosene and several strips of cardboard. It was a modified Molotov
cocktail, but not one to be tossed. The police guessed that the cardboard <a
name=page229></a>was to be used as kindling. It was a laughable effort at
arson, but then it doesn¡¯t take a genius to start a fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>While they chatted,
a television news van parked on the street in front of the office. Oscar put on
his tie and got himself filmed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A few hours later,
during the fourth firm meeting, David took the news hard but still insisted he
would not carry a gun. Rochelle kept a cheap pistol in her purse, so three of
the four were armed. Reporters were calling. The story was growing by the
moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Remember,¡± Wally
repeated to his colleagues, ¡°we¡¯re a boutique firm specializing in Krayoxx
cases. Everybody got that?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yeah, yeah,¡± Oscar
chimed in. ¡°And what about Burmese labor law violations?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That too.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The meeting broke
up when a reporter banged on the front door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was soon evident
that no law would be practiced that day at Finley &amp; Figg. David and Oscar
talked to the <span class=0Text>Tribune</span> and the <span class=0Text>Sun-Times</span>.
Details were being passed along. Mr. Bardall was out of surgery, locked in his
room, and not talking to anyone but his lawyer. The owner of Cicero Pipe and
two of his superintendents had been arrested and released on bail. The general
contractor on the water-treatment project was a blue-chip firm out of
Milwaukee, and it was promising to investigate matters quickly and thoroughly.
The job site was shut down. No undocumented worker would go near it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David finally left
before noon, quietly informing Rochelle he was needed in court somewhere. He
drove home, collected Helen, who was looking more pregnant by the day, and took
her to lunch. He explained recent events&#8212;the death threats, the thug and his
intentions, Oscar and his defense of the firm, and the growing interest from
the press. He downplayed any danger and assured her the FBI was on top of
things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Are you worried?¡±
she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not at all,¡± he
said, unconvincingly. ¡°But there could be something in the papers tomorrow.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para06 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.5pt'><span lang=EN>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page230></a><span
lang=EN>Indeed there was. Big photos of Oscar in the metro sections of both the
<span class=0Text>Tribune</span> and the <span class=0Text>Sun-Times</span>. In
all fairness to the press, how many stories do you get wherein an old lawyer is
bunking at his office and shoots an intruder who is carrying a Molotov cocktail
designed to burn down the building in retaliation for the firm¡¯s filing of a
wage dispute involving undocumented workers who are being abused by a company
that, years ago, had links to organized crime? Oscar was being portrayed as a fearless
gunslinger from the Southwest Side, and, by the way, one of the country¡¯s
leading mass tort specialists in the assault on Varrick Labs and its dreadful
drug Krayoxx. The <span class=0Text>Tribune</span> ran a smaller photo of
David, as well as shots of the owner of Cicero Pipe and his lieutenants as they
were being hauled into jail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The entire alphabet
was rushing in&#8212;FBI, DOL, ICE, INS, OSHA, DHS (Homeland Security), OFCCP (Office
of Federal Contract Compliance Programs)&#8212;and most had something to say to the reporters.
The job site was shut down for the second day, and the prime contractor was
screaming. Finley &amp; Figg was again besieged by reporters, investigators,
Krayoxx hopefuls, and more than the usual riffraff from the street. Oscar,
Wally, and Rochelle kept their weapons close. Young David remained blissfully
naive.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Two
weeks later, Justin Bardall left the hospital in a wheelchair. He and his boss,
along with one other, had been indicted on numerous charges by a federal grand
jury, and their lawyers were already discussing the possibility of plea
bargains. His left fibula was shattered and more surgery would be needed, but
his doctors expected a full recovery with time. He had mentioned to his
lawyers, his boss, and the police that the shattering of his left fibula had
been unnecessary; the shot was taken after he¡¯d been wounded and was no longer
a threat, but he found no sympathy. The general reaction could be summed up by
a detective who said, ¡°You¡¯re lucky he didn¡¯t blow your head off.¡±</span></p>

CHAPTER_30'><span lang=EN>CHAPTER 30</span></span></h1>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Jerry Alisandros finally made good on a promise.
He was extremely busy organizing the settlement negotiations, and according to
the associate Wally spoke to, he, Jerry, simply didn¡¯t have the time to spend
on the phone with the dozens of lawyers he was juggling. But in the third week
of July, he finally sent in the experts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The company¡¯s name
was meaningless&#8212;Allyance Diagnostic Group, or ADG, as it preferred to be
called. As best Wally could tell, ADG was an Atlanta-based team of medical
technicians who did nothing but travel the country running tests on people who
were clamoring to profit from Jerry¡¯s latest mass tort attack. As instructed,
Wally rented two thousand square feet in a dingy strip mall, a space that had
once housed a low-end pet supply store. He hired a contractor to erect walls
and doors and a cleaning service to fix things up. The front windows were
covered with brown paper; there was no signage. He rented a few cheap chairs
and tables and a desk and installed a phone and a copier. All bills were sent
by Wally to an assistant in Jerry¡¯s firm who did nothing but keep the books
dealing with the Krayoxx litigation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When the space was
ready, ADG moved in and went to work. Its team consisted of three technicians,
all properly attired in aqua surgical scrubs. Each had a stethoscope. They
looked so official that even Wally at first figured they were highly skilled
and credentialed. They were not, but they had tested thousands of potential
plaintiffs. Their leader was Dr. Borzov, a cardiologist from Russia who had
made a lot <a name=page232></a>of money diagnosing patients/clients for Jerry
Alisandros and a dozen other trial lawyers around the country. Dr. Borzov
rarely saw an obese person who wasn¡¯t suffering from a significant medical
problem that could be pinned on the mass-tort-drug-of-the-month. He never
testified in court&#8212;his accent was too thick and his r&eacute;sum&eacute; was too thin&#8212;but he
was worth his weight in gold in the screening rooms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David, because he
was the de facto paralegal for all (now) 430 non-death Krayoxx clients, and
Wally, because he had hustled them all together, were both present when ADG
began its assembly line. On schedule, three clients arrived at 8:00 a.m. and
were greeted with coffee, Wally, and a cute ADG technician in scrubs and white
rubber hospital clogs. The paperwork took ten minutes and was primarily
designed to ensure that the client had indeed taken Krayoxx for more than six
months. The first client was led into another room where ADG had installed its
own echocardiogram and two other technicians were waiting. One explained the
procedure&#8212;¡°We¡¯re just taking a digital picture of your heart¡±&#8212;while the other
helped the client onto an official, heavily fortified hospital bed that ADG
hauled around the country, along with the echocardiogram. As they probed the
patient¡¯s chest with the sonar, Dr. Borzov entered the room and nodded slightly
at the patient. His bedside manner was never reassuring, but then he had no
real patients. He wore a full-length white exam coat, had his name stenciled
above the left pocket, and had his own stethoscope for good measure and effect,
and when he spoke, his accent conveyed a sense of expertise. He studied the
screen, frowned because he always frowned, then left the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The assault on
Krayoxx was fueled by research purporting to show that the drug weakened the
seals around the aortic valve, thus causing a decrease in mitral valve
regurgitation. The echocardiogram measured aortic sufficiency, and a decrease
of 30 percent was excellent news for the lawyers. Dr. Borzov reviewed the
graphs immediately, always eager to find another weakened aortic valve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Each exam took
twenty minutes, so they did three per hour, about twenty-five each day, six
days a week. Wally had leased the space for a <a name=page233></a>month. ADG
billed the Zell &amp; Potter, Finley &amp; Figg litigation account $1,000 for
each exam, with the bills going to Jerry in Florida.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Before that stop,
ADG and Dr. Borzov had been in Charleston and Buffalo. From Chicago, they were
headed to Memphis, then Little Rock. Another ADG unit was covering the West
Coast with a Serbian doctor reading the graphs. Another was harvesting gold in
Texas. The Zell &amp; Potter Krayoxx web covered forty states, seventy-five
lawyers, and almost 80,000 clients.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>To
avoid the chaos of the office, David hung around the strip mall and chatted
with his clients, none of whom he¡¯d ever met. Generally speaking, they were
happy to be there, worried about whatever damage the drug had done to their
hearts, hopeful of some type of recovery, overweight and terribly out of shape,
but pleasant enough. Black, white, old, young, male, female&#8212;obesity and high
cholesterol ran the gamut. Every client he spoke to had been thrilled with the
drug, delighted with its results, and was now anxious about finding a
replacement. Gradually, David chatted up the ADG technicians and learned
something of their work, though they were fairly closemouthed. Dr. Borzov would
hardly speak to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After hanging
around for three days, David could tell that the ADG team was not pleased with
their testing. Their $1,000 exams were producing little evidence of aortic
insufficiency, but there were a few potential cases.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On the fourth day,
the air-conditioning system crashed, and Wally¡¯s rented space turned into a
sweatshop. It was August, temperature above ninety, and when the landlord
refused to return calls, the ADG crew threatened to leave. Wally hauled in box
fans and ice cream and begged them to stay and finish the screening. They
plowed on, the twenty-minute exams becoming fifteen, then ten, with Borzov
barely scanning the graphs on the sidewalk while he smoked cigarettes.</span></p>

lang=EN>Judge Seawright set the hearing for August 10, the last possible date
on any judge¡¯s calendar before the system shut down for summer vacation. There
were no motions pending, no fights brewing, all discovery had proceeded with
remarkable cooperation. Varrick Labs, so far, had been unduly forthcoming with
documents, witnesses, and experts. Nadine Karros had filed only a handful of
benign motions, all of which the judge quickly dispensed with. On the
plaintiff¡¯s side, the Zell &amp; Potter lawyers had been remarkably efficient
with their requests and filings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Seawright was
monitoring the settlement gossip. His clerks scoured the financial press and
watched the serious bloggers. Varrick Labs had issued no formal statement
regarding settlement, but it was obvious the company knew how to leak. Its
share price dipped as low as $24.50, but the buzz about a massive settlement
had moved it back to $30.00.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When the two packs
of lawyers were in place, Judge Seawright assumed the bench and welcomed
everyone. He apologized for calling the hearing in August&#8212;¡°the most difficult
month of the year for busy people¡±&#8212;but he felt strongly that the two sides
should get together before everyone scattered. He quickly went through his
discovery checklist to make sure both sides were behaving. There were no
complaints.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Jerry Alisandros
and Nadine Karros were so polite to each other it was almost silly. Wally sat
to Jerry¡¯s right, as if he would be the go-to guy in a courtroom brawl. Behind
him, and wedged among a group of Zell &amp; Potter lawyers, were David and
Oscar. Since the shooting and the publicity, Oscar was getting out more,
enjoying the attention. He was also smiling and already considered himself a
bachelor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Changing subjects,
Judge Seawright said, ¡°I¡¯m hearing a lot of chatter about a settlement, one big
global settlement, as they¡¯re called these days in this business. I want to
know what¡¯s going on. As fast as this particular case has come together, it is
now in a posture to be placed on my trial calendar. However, if a settlement is
likely, then why bother? Can you shed any light on this issue, Ms. Karros?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She stood, all eyes
on her, and took a few elegant steps to the <a name=page235></a>podium. ¡°Your
Honor, as you probably know, Varrick Labs has been involved in a number of
complicated lawsuits, and the company has its own way of approaching a
settlement that involves many plaintiffs. I have not been authorized to
initiate negotiations in the Klopeck case, nor have I been authorized by my client
to make public statements on the issue of settlement. As far as I¡¯m concerned,
we are preparing for trial.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Fair enough. Mr.
Alisandros?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They exchanged
places at the podium, and Jerry offered up a sappy smile. ¡°Likewise, Your
Honor, we are preparing for trial in this case. However, I must say that I, as
a member of the Plaintiffs¡¯ Litigation Committee, have had several informal and
quite preliminary conversations with the company regarding a global settlement.
I believe Ms. Karros is aware that these conversations are taking place, but,
as she said, she has not been authorized to discuss them. I don¡¯t represent
Varrick so I am not burdened with such constraints. However, the company has
not requested that I remain silent about our discussions. In addition, Your
Honor, if we reach the point of formal negotiations, I doubt that Ms. Karros
will be involved. I know from prior experience that Varrick handles these
in-house.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Do you anticipate
formal negotiations?¡± asked Seawright.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There was a long
pause as many held their breath. Nadine Karros managed to look curious, though
she had a clear view of the big picture. No one else in the courtroom did.
Wally¡¯s heart was racing as he tasted the words ¡°formal negotiations.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Jerry shifted
weight a few times, then finally said, ¡°Judge, I don¡¯t want to get quoted, so
I¡¯ll go the safe route and say that I¡¯m not sure.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So you, and Ms.
Karros, cannot give me any guidance on the issue of settlement?¡± Seawright said
with a hint of frustration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Both lawyers shook
their heads. Nadine knew damn well the case wouldn¡¯t be settled. Jerry was
almost positive that it would. Neither, though, could play his or her hand.
And, truthfully and ethically, the judge did not have the right to know their
strategies outside the courtroom. His job was to referee a fair trial, not
monitor settlements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page236></a><span
lang=EN>Jerry returned to his seat, and Judge Seawright changed subjects again.
¡°I¡¯m looking at October 17, a Monday, as a trial date. I anticipate the trial
will last no longer than two weeks.¡± A dozen lawyers were instantly looking at
their calendars, all frowning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°If you have a
conflict, it had better be a good one,¡± he said. ¡°Mr. Alisandros?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Jerry stood slowly,
holding a small leather appointment book. ¡°Well, Judge, that would mean that we¡¯re
going to trial ten months after the lawsuit was filed. That¡¯s pretty quick,
don¡¯t you think?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Indeed it is, Mr.
Alisandros. Eleven months is about my average. I don¡¯t allow my cases to grow
stale. What¡¯s your conflict?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No conflict,
Judge, but I¡¯m more concerned with having sufficient time to prepare. That¡¯s
all.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Hogwash. Discovery
is almost complete. You have your experts. The defendant has its experts. God
knows both sides have enough legal talent. October 17 is sixty-eight days away.
That should be a piece of cake for a litigator of your reputation, Mr.
Alisandros.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>What a show,
thought Wally. This case, and all the others, would be settled in a month.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What about the
defense, Ms. Karros?¡± Seawright asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We have some
conflicts, Your Honor,¡± she said. ¡°But nothing that we cannot work around.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Very well. The
case of Klopeck versus Varrick Labs is hereby set for jury trial on October 17.

CHAPTER_31'><span lang=EN>CHAPTER 31</span></span></h1>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>News of the trial date swept through the
financial press and was all over the Internet. The story was spun various ways,
but in general it looked as though Varrick was being frog-marched into a
federal courtroom to answer for its multitude of sins. Reuben Massey did not
care how the story was told, nor did he care what the public thought at that
moment. To the tort bar, it was important to react as if his company was shaken
and frightened. He understood trial lawyers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Three days after
the hearing in Chicago, Nicholas Walker phoned Jerry Alisandros and suggested
they arrange a secret meeting between the company and the biggest tort firms
involved with Krayoxx. The purpose of the meeting would be to throw open the
door to full-scale negotiations. Alisandros jumped at the idea and gravely
vowed total silence. From the twenty or so years he¡¯d been dealing with trial
lawyers, Nicholas knew the meeting would not be a secret because one (or more) of
the lawyers would tip the press.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The following day,
a blurb in the <span class=0Text>Wall Street Journal</span> reported that
Cymbol, Varrick¡¯s principal insurance company, had been put on notice by the
company that its reserve fund was about to be activated. Citing an anonymous
source, the story went on to speculate that the only reason for such an action
was to settle its ¡°Krayoxx mess.¡± Other leaks followed, and the bloggers were
soon declaring another victory for consumers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page238></a><span
lang=EN>Since every trial lawyer worth his salt owned his own jet, the
destination was no problem. With New York City deserted in August, Nicholas
Walker secured a large meeting room on the fortieth floor of a half-empty
midtown hotel. Many of the trial lawyers were out of the office, off somewhere
dodging the heat, but not a single invitation was declined. A large settlement
was far more important than a few days of vacation. When they convened, eight
days after Judge Seawright set the date for the first trial, there were the six
members of the Plaintiffs¡¯ Litigation Committee, plus another thirty trial
lawyers, each with thousands of Krayoxx cases. Those as insignificant as Wally
Figg did not even know of the meeting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Large young men in
dark suits guarded the door to the meeting room and checked credentials. After
a quick breakfast the first morning, Nicholas Walker welcomed everyone as if
they were all salesmen for the same company. He even cracked a joke and got a
laugh, but just under the surface there was tension. An avalanche of money was
about to be unleashed, and the lawyers in the room were seasoned brawlers,
ready for hand-to-hand combat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>So far, there were
eleven hundred death cases. Or in other words, eleven hundred cases in which
the dead person¡¯s estate claimed Krayoxx was the cause. The medical proof was
not exactly ironclad, though it was probably sufficient to become a question
for a jury. Going along with their master plan, Nicholas Walker and Judy Beck
spent almost no time discussing the basic issue of liability. They presumed, as
did the horde on the other side, that the drug was responsible for eleven
hundred deaths and thousands of other injuries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After the
formalities, Walker began by saying that Varrick would like to nail down the
value of each death case. Assuming that could be done, they would then move on
to the non-death cases.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally
was on the shore of Lake Michigan, in a small rental a block off the water,
with his darling DeeAnna, who was a knockout in a bikini, and he had just
finished some pasta salad when his cell phone <a name=page239></a>chirped. He
saw the number, snatched the phone, and said, ¡°Jerry, my man, what¡¯s going on?¡±
DeeAnna, topless in a nearby lounge chair, perked up too. She knew that any
call from dear Jerry could be thrilling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Jerry explained
that he was back in Florida after two days in New York, secret meeting and all,
hammering things out with Varrick, tough bunch, just the death cases, you know,
but anyway, lots of progress, no deal, no handshake, certainly nothing in
writing, but it looks as though each death case will be somewhere around $2
million.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally hummed along
with an occasional smile at DeeAnna, who had inched closer. ¡°Good news, Jerry,
nice work. Let¡¯s chat next week.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What¡¯s up?¡± she
cooed when the call was over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Nothing, really.
Just an update from Jerry. Varrick has filed a bunch of motions and he wants me
to take a look.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No settlement?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Nope.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>All she talked
about now was the settlement. Sure, it was his fault for running his big mouth,
but the woman was obsessed with the settlement. She didn¡¯t have enough sense to
play along as though she couldn¡¯t have cared less. No. She wanted details.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She wanted money,
and this was worrying Wally. He was already thinking of an exit strategy, just
like his new hero Oscar. Ditch the women before the money arrives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Sixteen million
dollars. Seventeen percent of which would flow into the coffers of Finley &amp;
Figg, a total of $2.7 million, of which Wally would take 50 percent. He was a
millionaire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He crawled onto an
air mattress and floated across the pool. He closed his eyes and tried not to
grin. Soon DeeAnna was next to him, floating on the water, still topless,
touching him occasionally to make sure he still needed her. They had been
together for many months now, and Wally was finally getting bored. He was
finding it more difficult to keep up with her constant demands for sex. He was,
after all, forty-six, ten years older than DeeAnna, though her actual birth
date was a moving target. The day and month had been nailed down, but the year <a
name=page240></a>kept inching forward. He was tired and needed a break, and he
was also concerned about her fascination with his Krayoxx money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It would be in his
best interests to ditch her now, do the breakup routine, one he knew well, and
get her out of his life and away from the money. This would not be easy and
would take some time. Such a strategy would work well for Oscar too. Paula
Finley had hired an obnoxious divorce lawyer named Stamm, and he was banging
the war drums. During their first phone chat, Stamm expressed surprise at how
little money Oscar cleared from his law practice and went on to imply that
money was being hidden. He probed into the murky world of fees paid in cash,
but he got nothing from Wally, who knew that territory well. Stamm mentioned
the Krayoxx litigation, but got stiff-armed by Wally¡¯s well-rehearsed denials
that Oscar was involved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, it looks
suspicious,¡± Stamm had said. ¡°Mr. Finley is willing to walk away with nothing
but his car and clothes after thirty years of marriage.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh no,¡± Wally had
protested. ¡°It makes perfect sense if you really got to know Paula Finley, your
client.¡± They bickered for a while, as divorce lawyers do, then promised to
talk later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As bad as Wally
wanted the money, he decided to delay the actual receipt of the cash for
several months. Do the paperwork now, or in the next few weeks, keep it under
wraps in court, then get rid of the women.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For
what was supposed to be the slowest month of the year, August was proving to be
quite productive. On August 22, Helen Zinc gave birth to an eight-pound girl,
Emma, and for a couple of days her parents acted as though they had produced
the first baby in history. Mother and child were in perfect health, and when
they arrived home, all four grandparents were waiting, along with two dozen
friends. David took a week off and found it impossible to stay out of the
little pink nursery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He was called back
into action by an angry federal judge, one who evidently did not believe in
vacations and was rumored to work ninety <a name=page241></a>hours a week. Her
name was Sally Archer, or Sudden Sal, as she had been aptly nicknamed. She was
young and brash, extremely bright, and in the process of driving her staff into
the ground. Sudden Sal ruled quickly and wanted every lawsuit settled the day
after it was filed. David¡¯s labor case had been assigned to Archer, who had
minced no words in voicing her low opinion of Cicero Pipe and its sleazy
practices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Under pressure from
multiple arms of the federal government, and Sudden Sal as well, the prime
contractor convinced its sub, Cicero Pipe, to clean up its labor mess and legal
problems and get on with its portion of the water-treatment plant. The criminal
charges against the would-be arsonist, Justin Bardall, and others at the
company would take months to untangle, but the wage-and-hour dispute could, and
would, be wrapped up quickly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Six weeks after
filing the lawsuit, David hammered out a settlement that was hard for him to
believe. Cicero Pipe agreed to pay to each of his five clients the lump sum of
$40,000. In addition, the company would pay $30,000 each to another three dozen
undocumented workers, most Mexican and Guatemalan, who had been paid $200 a
week for at least eighty hours.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Because of the
notoriety of the case, said notoriety being greatly enhanced by Oscar¡¯s
vigorous defense of his own property and the ensuing arrest of the wealthy
owner of Cicero Pipe, the hearing before Sudden Sal attracted some reporters.
Judge Archer began by recapping the lawsuit, and in doing so guaranteed she
would be quoted by describing Cicero Pipe¡¯s abuses as ¡°slave labor.¡± She lashed
out at the company, rebuked its lawyers, who were actually pretty nice guys in
David¡¯s opinion, and in general grandstanded for thirty minutes as the
reporters scribbled away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Mr. Zinc, are you
satisfied with this settlement?¡± Her Honor inquired. The agreement was in
writing. The deal had been cut a week earlier; the only remaining issue was
attorneys¡¯ fees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, Your Honor,¡±
David said quietly. The three lawyers for Cicero Pipe hunkered down, almost
afraid to look up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page242></a><span
lang=EN>¡°I see that you have submitted a request for attorneys¡¯ fees,¡± Sudden
Sal observed as she looked at some paperwork. ¡°Fifty-eight hours. I would say,
in light of what you have accomplished and the money you¡¯ve obtained for all
these workers, that your time has been well spent.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thank you, Your
Honor,¡± David said. He was standing at his table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What is your
hourly rate, Mr. Zinc?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, Your Honor,
I have been anticipating that question, and the truth is that I really don¡¯t
have an hourly rate. My clients can¡¯t afford to pay by the hour.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Archer
nodded. ¡°In the past year, have you billed anyone by the hour?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh sure. Until
last December, I was a senior associate at Rogan Rothberg.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The judge laughed
into her microphone and said, ¡°Oh boy. Talk about experts at the hourly rate.
What were you worth back then, Mr. Zinc?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David shifted
uncomfortably and shrugged. ¡°Judge, the last time I worked on the clock, the
client was billed $500 an hour.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Then you¡¯re worth
$500 an hour.¡± Sudden Sal scribbled for a few seconds, then announced, ¡°Let¡¯s
round it off to $30,000. Any objections, Mr. Lattimore?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The defendant¡¯s
chief counsel stood and paused and pondered what to say. Objecting would do no
good because the judge was clearly in the other camp. His client was getting clobbered
so badly anyway, what was another $30,000? And if Lattimore expressed
misgivings about the fees, he knew that Sudden Sal would hit him with a quick
¡°Well, then, Mr. Lattimore, what¡¯s your hourly rate?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sounds
reasonable,¡± Lattimore said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good. I want all
funds exchanged within thirty days. Court¡¯s adjourned.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Outside the
courtroom, David spent time with three reporters, patiently answering their
questions. When he was finished, he drove <a name=page243></a>to the apartment
of Soe and Lwin, where he met with his three Burmese clients and broke the news
that they would soon receive checks for $40,000 each. The message wasn¡¯t clear
in translation, and Soe repeated himself several times to convince the men.
They laughed and thought it was all a joke, but David refused to laugh along.
When reality set in, two of the three began crying. The third was too shocked.
David tried to make the point that they had earned the money with their sweat
and labor, but this, too, did not translate well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David was in no
hurry. He had been away from his new daughter for all of six hours, a record,
but she wasn¡¯t going anywhere. He sipped tea from a tiny cup and chatted with
his clients, glowing in his first major victory. He had taken a case that most
lawyers would refuse. His clients had bravely stepped out from the shadows of
illegal immigration to confront a wrong, and David had coaxed them into it.
Three little guys a million miles from home, abused by a big company with
plenty of big friends, nothing between them and more abuse except a young
attorney and a court of law. Justice, with its flaws and ambiguities, had
prevailed in a magnificent way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Driving to the
office, alone, David was filled with immense pride and a sense of
accomplishment. He hoped to have many great wins in the future, but this one
would always be special. Never, in five years with the big firm, had he ever
felt so proud of being a lawyer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was late and the
office was deserted. Wally was on vacation, checking in occasionally with the
latest Krayoxx update. Oscar was AWOL for a few days, not even Rochelle knew
where he¡¯d gone. David checked his phone messages and mail, puttered around his
desk for a few minutes, then got bored with it. As he locked the front door, a
police car pulled to a stop in front of the building. Friends of Oscar¡¯s,
keeping an eye on the place. David waved at the two officers and headed home.</span></p>

<p class=Para05 style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As you know, our trial
is set for next month, October 17 to be exact, but this is not something to
worry about. I spent most of last month negotiating with the attorneys at
Varrick, and we have arrived at a very favorable settlement. The company is in
the process of offering a sum in the neighborhood of $2 million for the
wrongful death of your husband, Percy. This offer is not official, but we
expect to receive it in writing within the next fifteen days. I know this is
considerably more than the $1 million I promised, but, nonetheless, I need your
approval to accept this offer when it is formally put on the table. I¡¯m quite
proud of our little boutique firm. We are like David battling Goliath, but
right now we¡¯re winning</span><span class=0Text><span lang=EN style='font-style:

<p class=Para05 style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Attorney and
Counselor-at-Law</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He
sent similar letters to the other seven clients in his wonderful little class
of death cases, and when he finished, he kicked back in <a name=page245></a>his
swivel rocker, placed his shoeless feet on his desk, and once again
contemplated the money. His dreams were interrupted, though, when Rochelle
buzzed in with a curt ¡°That woman is on the phone. Please talk to her. She¡¯s
driving me crazy.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Okay,¡± Wally
snapped and stared at the phone. DeeAnna was not going away quietly. During the
drive home from Lake Michigan, he had picked a fight with her and managed to
escalate it to the level of some serious name-calling. In the heat of the
battle, he had announced that they were through, and for two tranquil days
thereafter they did not speak. Then she showed up at his apartment, drunk, and
he relented and allowed her to sleep on the sofa. She was apologetic, even
pitiful, and managed to offer some manner of sexual adventure every five
minutes. Wally had declined, so far. Now she was calling at all hours and had
even appeared at the office several times. But Wally was determined. It had
become clear to him that his Krayoxx money wouldn¡¯t last three months with
DeeAnna in the picture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He picked up the
phone and offered a brusque ¡°Hello.¡± She was already crying.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The
windy, gloomy Monday would long be remembered at Zell &amp; Potter as the Labor
Day Massacre. No holiday was being observed&#8212;they were professionals, not
laborers, not that it mattered. Holidays were often ignored, as were weekends.
The building was open early, and by 8:00 a.m. the halls were buzzing with
lawyers eagerly pursuing a variety of defective drugs and the companies that
made them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Occasionally,
though, a pursuit yielded nothing. A chase went nowhere. A well was dry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The first blow
landed at 9:00 a.m., when Dr. Julian Smitzer, the firm¡¯s director of medical
research, insisted on seeing Jerry Alisandros, who really didn¡¯t have the time
but couldn¡¯t say no, especially when the matter was described by his secretary
as ¡°urgent.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Dr. Smitzer had
completed an illustrious career as a cardiologist and <a name=page246></a>researcher
at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and with an ailing wife headed for the
sunshine of south Florida. After a few months, he was bored. By chance he met
Jerry Alisandros. One meeting led to another, and for the past five years Dr.
Smitzer had supervised the law firm¡¯s medical research, at an annual salary of
$1 million. It was a natural fit because he had spent most of his career
writing about the evils of Big Pharma.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In a law firm full
of hyperaggressive lawyers, Dr. Smitzer was a revered figure. No one questioned
his research or his opinions, and his work was far more valuable than what he
was paid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We have a problem
with Krayoxx,¡± he said not long after he¡¯d taken a seat in Jerry¡¯s grand
office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After a deep,
painful breath, Jerry said, ¡°I¡¯m listening.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯ve spent the
past six months analyzing the McFadden research, and I am now of the opinion
that it is flawed. There is no credible statistical evidence that the consumers
of the drug have a higher risk of stroke and heart attack. Frankly, McFadden
fudged his results. He¡¯s an excellent doctor and researcher, but he obviously
became convinced the drug was dangerous, then tweaked his findings to fit his
conclusions. The people who take this drug have many other problems&#8212;obesity,
diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, to name a few. Many are in terrible
health, and elevated cholesterol can be expected. Typically, they take a
handful of pills several times a day, Krayoxx being just one, and so far it has
been impossible to determine the effects of the combinations of all these
drugs. Statistically, there might, and I emphasize that word, be a slight
increased chance for a heart attack or stroke by Krayoxx users, but then again
there may not be. McFadden studied three thousand subjects over a two-year
period&#8212;a small pool in my opinion&#8212;and found only a 9 percent higher chance of
stroke and heart attack.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ve read the
report, Julian, many times,¡± Jerry said, interrupting. ¡°I practically memorized
it before we jumped into this litigation.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You jumped in too
fast, Jerry. There¡¯s nothing wrong with this <a name=page247></a>drug. I¡¯ve
spoken with McFadden at length. You know how heavily he was criticized when the
report came out. He¡¯s taken the heat, and now he¡¯s backing off the drug.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes. McFadden
admitted to me last week that he should have included more subjects. He¡¯s also
concerned with the fact that he did not spend the time studying the effects of
the combinations of multiple drugs. He is planning to reverse himself and try
to salvage his reputation.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Jerry was pinching
the bridge of his nose as if he might crush it. ¡°No, no, no,¡± he kept mumbling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Smitzer pressed on.
¡°Yes, yes, and his repair work will be forthcoming.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°When?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Roughly ninety
days. And it gets worse. We¡¯ve studied, thoroughly, the effects of the drug on
the aortic valve. As you know, the Palo Alto study seemed to link the leakage
in the valve to a deterioration caused by the drug. This now looks doubtful,
highly so.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Why are you
telling me this now, Julian?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Because the
research takes time, and we are just now learning a few things.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What does Dr.
Bannister say?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, for
starters, he says he¡¯s not willing to testify.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Jerry rubbed his
temples and stood, glaring at his friend. He walked to a window and looked out,
at nothing. Since Dr. Smitzer was on the firm¡¯s payroll, he was precluded from
testifying in any Zell &amp; Potter litigation, either in discovery or at
trial. An important part of his job was maintaining a network of expert
witnesses&#8212;hired guns willing to take the stand for huge fees. Dr. Bannister was
a professional testifier with a thick r&eacute;sum&eacute; and a fondness for mixing it up
with hotshot lawyers in big trials. The fact that he was now backing down
seemed fatal.</span></p>

<p class=Para06 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.5pt'><span lang=EN>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page248></a><span
lang=EN>The second blow landed an hour later with Jerry already on the ropes
and bleeding. A young partner named Carlton arrived with a thick report and
some grim news. ¡°Things are not going well, Jerry,¡± he began.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I know.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Carlton was
supervising the screening of thousands of potential clients, and his thick
report was filled with terrible numbers. ¡°We¡¯re not seeing the damage, Jerry.
Ten thousand exams so far, and the results are not impressive. Maybe 10 percent
have some loss of aortic pressure, but nothing to get excited about. We¡¯re
seeing all sorts of heart disease, hypertension, clogged arteries, and the
like, but nothing we can link to the drug.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Ten million bucks
on screenings and we have nothing?¡± Jerry said, thumbs on temples, eyes closed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°At least ten
million, and, yes, we have nothing. I hate to say this, Jerry, but this drug
looks harmless. I think we¡¯re drilling a dry hole here. I¡¯d say we cut and
run.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I didn¡¯t ask for
advice.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, you didn¡¯t.¡±
Carlton left the office and closed the door. Jerry locked it and went to a sofa
where he stretched out and stared at the ceiling. He had been there
before&#8212;caught with a drug that wasn¡¯t quite as bad as he had claimed it to be.
There was still a chance Varrick was a step or two behind. Perhaps the company
didn¡¯t know what Jerry now knew. With all the settlement buzz, its share price
had moved steadily up, closing the Friday before at $34.50. Maybe, just maybe,
the company could be bluffed into an even quicker settlement. He had seen it before.
A company with plenty of cash and a ton of bad press wants the lawsuits and
lawyers to simply go away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As the minutes
passed, he managed to relax. He couldn¡¯t think of all the Wally Figgs out
there&#8212;they were big boys who had made their own decisions to file suit. And he
couldn¡¯t think of all the clients who were expecting a sizable check, and soon.
Nor was he too concerned with saving face&#8212;he was obscenely rich, and the money
had long since toughened his skin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page249></a><span
lang=EN>What Jerry was really thinking about was the next drug, the one after
Krayoxx.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The
third blow, and the knockout punch, arrived in a scheduled 3:00 p.m. phone
conference with another member of the Plaintiffs¡¯ Litigation Committee (PLC).
Rodney Berman was a flamboyant New Orleans trial lawyer who had made and lost
several fortunes gambling with juries. Thanks to an oil spill in the Gulf, he
was currently in the money and had managed to piece together even more Krayoxx
clients than Zell &amp; Potter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯re up shit
creek,¡± he began pleasantly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s been a bad
day, Rodney, so go ahead and make it worse.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Inside scoop from
a very confidential, and very well-paid, I might add, spook who has laid eyes
on a preliminary report headed for the <span class=0Text>New England Journal of
Medicine</span> next month. Researchers at Harvard and Cleveland Clinic will
declare that our beloved Krayoxx is as healthy as wheat germ and causes no
problems whatsoever. No increased risk of heart attack or stroke. No damage to
the aortic valve. Nothing. And these boys have r&eacute;sum&eacute;s that make our guys look
like witch doctors. My experts are running for the hills. My lawyers are hiding
under their desks. According to one of our lobbyists, the FDA is considering
putting the drug back on the market. Varrick is dropping cash all over
Washington. What else do you want to hear, Jerry?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I think I¡¯ve heard
enough. I¡¯m looking for a bridge.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I can see one from
my office,¡± Rodney said, somehow managing a laugh. ¡°It¡¯s beautiful, spanning
the Mississippi and just waiting on me. The Rodney Berman Memorial Bridge. They¡¯d
find me in the Gulf one day, covered in crude oil.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Four hours later,
all six of the PLC members were linked into a conference call Jerry organized
from his office. After he summarized the grim news of the day, Berman delivered
his version. Each of the six took a turn, and there was not a single piece of
good news. The litigation was crumbling on all fronts, on all theories, from
coast to <a name=page250></a>coast. There was a lengthy debate over how much
Varrick knew at the moment, and the general feeling was that they, the lawyers,
were far ahead of the company. But that would change quickly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They agreed to stop
the screening immediately. Jerry volunteered to contact Nicholas Walker at
Varrick and attempt to speed up settlement talks. Each of the six agreed to
begin buying huge chunks of Varrick common stock in an effort to drive up the
price. It was a public corporation, after all, and its share price meant
everything. If Varrick believed a settlement would soothe Wall Street, it might
decide to get rid of its Krayoxx mess, however harmless the drug might be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The conference call
lasted two hours and ended with a tone that was slightly more optimistic than
when it began. They would continue pushing hard for a few more days, maintain
their poker faces, play the game, and hope for a miracle, but under no
circumstances would they continue spending money on their own Krayoxx mess. It
was over; they would cut their losses and move on to the next battle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Almost nothing was
said about the Klopeck trial six weeks away.</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Two days later, Jerry Alisandros made a seemingly
routine phone call to Nicholas Walker at Varrick Labs. They went through the
weather and some football, then Jerry got around to business. ¡°I¡¯m in your neck
of the woods next week, Nick, and I¡¯d like to stop by for a meeting, if you¡¯re
in and have the time.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Maybe,¡± Walker
said cautiously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Our numbers are
coming together nicely and we¡¯ve made progress, at least on the death cases.
I¡¯ve spent hours with the PLC and we¡¯re ready to enter into a formal settlement
agreement, round one, of course. Let¡¯s get the big cases out of the way and
then slog through the small ones.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s our plan,
Jerry,¡± Walker said, in full agreement, and Jerry finally managed to breathe.
¡°I¡¯m taking heat from Reuben Massey to get this stuff out of the way. He chewed
me for breakfast this morning and I was planning to call you. Massey has
instructed me to get down there with our in-house team and our Florida firms
and hammer out a settlement along the same lines as what we have already
discussed. I suggest we meet in Fort Lauderdale a week from today, sign the
agreement, present it to the judge, and move on. The non-death cases will take
longer, but let¡¯s get the big ones closed. Agreed?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Agreed? You have no
idea, Jerry thought. ¡°A great idea, Nick. I¡¯ll set it up down here.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But I insist that
all six PLC members be in the room.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page252></a><span
lang=EN>¡°I can arrange that, no problem.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And can we get a
magistrate or someone from the judge¡¯s office to be present? I¡¯m not leaving
there until we have a deal, in writing and approved by the court.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Excellent idea,
Nick.¡± Jerry was grinning like an idiot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Let¡¯s get it
done.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After the call,
Jerry checked the market. Varrick was trading at $36, and the only plausible
reason for its uptick was the good spin about the settlement.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The
phone conversation had been recorded by a company specializing in truth and
deception. It was a firm Zell &amp; Potter used frequently to secretly record
conversations in an effort to determine the level of veracity on the other end.
Thirty minutes after Jerry hung up, two experts entered his office with some
graphs and charts. They had camped out in a small conference room down the hall
with their staff and machines. They had measured the stress of both voices and
had easily determined that both men were lying. Jerry¡¯s lies had been planned,
of course, in an effort to prompt Walker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Walker¡¯s
voice-stress analysis showed a high level of deception. When he spoke of Reuben
Massey and the company¡¯s desire to get rid of the litigation, he was telling
the truth. But when he spoke of the big plans for a settlement summit next week
in Fort Lauderdale, he was clearly being deceptive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Jerry gave the
impression of taking the news in stride. Such evidence was never admissible in
court because it was so wildly unreliable. He had often asked himself why he
even bothered with voice-stress analysis, but after using it for years, he
almost believed it. Anything to give him a slight edge. Such recordings were
highly unethical anyway, and even illegal in some states, so it was easy to
bury the information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For most of the
past fifteen years, he had kept Varrick on the run with one lawsuit after
another. And in doing so, he had learned much about the company. Its research
was always better than that of the <a name=page253></a>plaintiffs. It hired
spies and invested heavily in corporate espionage. Reuben Massey loved hardball
and usually found a way to win the war, even after losing most of the battles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Alone in his
office, Jerry typed an entry into his private daily log: ¡°Krayoxx is
evaporating before my eyes. Just spoke with N. Walker who plans to be here next
week to sign a deal. 80&#8211;20 chance he doesn¡¯t show.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Iris
Klopeck shared Wally¡¯s letter with several friends and family members, and the
imminent arrival of $2 million was already causing problems. Clint, her
deadbeat son, who routinely went days without offering her as much as a rude
grunt or two, was suddenly showing all manner of affection. He was cleaning his
room, washing dishes, running errands for his dear mother, and chattering away
nonstop, his favorite topic being his desire for a new car. Iris¡¯s brother,
fresh from his second stint in prison for stealing motorcycles, was painting
her house (with no charge for the labor) and dropping hints about his longtime
dream of owning a used motorcycle business. He knew of one on the market for
only $100,000. ¡°A steal,¡± he said, at which her son whispered behind his back,
¡°He should know a steal when he sees one.¡± Percy¡¯s wretched sister Bertha was
letting it be known that she was entitled to a chunk of the money because she
was ¡°blood.¡± Iris loathed the woman, as had Percy, and Iris had already
reminded Bertha that she had not attended Percy¡¯s funeral. Bertha was now
claiming she had been hospitalized on that day. ¡°Prove it,¡± Iris said, and so
they bickered.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On
the day Adam Grand received his letter from Wally, he was hustling around the
all-you-can-eat pizza house when his boss barked at him for no apparent reason.
Adam, the assistant manager, returned the favor, and a nasty row ensued. When
the shouting and cursing ended, Adam either quit or was fired, and for several
minutes both men argued <a name=page254></a>over the exact nature of Adam¡¯s
departure. Not that it mattered&#8212;he was gone. And that didn¡¯t matter to Adam
either, because he was about to be rich.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Millie
Marino had the good sense to show her letter to no one. She read it several
times before the words began to sink in, and she felt a twinge of guilt for
doubting Wally¡¯s ability. He still failed to inspire confidence, and she was
still angry over her late husband Chester¡¯s will and estate, but those issues
were now of fading importance. Chester¡¯s son, Lyle, would be entitled to his
portion, and for that reason he had been monitoring the litigation. If he knew
how close they were to pay dirt, he might become a nuisance. So Millie put the
letter under lock and key and told no one.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On
September 9, five weeks after being shot in both legs, Justin Bardall filed a
lawsuit against Oscar individually and Finley &amp; Figg as a partnership. He
alleged Oscar used ¡°excessive force¡± in the shooting and, in particular,
deliberately fired the third shot into the left leg after Bardall was seriously
wounded and no longer posed a threat. The lawsuit demanded $5 million in actual
damages and $10 million in punitive damages for Oscar¡¯s malicious conduct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The lawyer who
filed the case, Goodloe Stamm, was the same lawyer hired by Paula Finley to
handle her divorce. Evidently, at some point Stamm tracked down Bardall and
convinced him to sue, in spite of his criminal activities and the fact that he
was about to spend time in prison for attempted arson.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The divorce was
proving to be more contentious than Wally or Oscar had expected, especially in
light of the fact that Oscar was basically walking away with nothing but his
car and clothes. Stamm kept chirping about the big Krayoxx money and smelled a
conspiracy to hide it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar was furious
over the $15 million lawsuit and blamed everything <a name=page255></a>on
David. Had it not been for the wage case filed against Cicero Pipe, he and Bardall
would have never met. Wally managed to broker a truce, and the yelling stopped.
He contacted their insurance company and insisted it provide a defense and
coverage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With the big
settlement so close, it was much easier to make peace, to smile, even to joke
about the image of that little thug Bardall limping into court and trying to
convince a jury he, an incompetent arsonist, should be made rich because he
failed to burn down a law office.</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>The e-mail was prefaced with the standard
warnings of confidentiality and protected with encryption codes. It was written
by Jerry Alisandros and sent to about eighty lawyers, one of whom was Wally
Figg. It read:</span></p>

<p class=Para18 style='margin-top:.05in;margin-right:12.0pt;margin-bottom:.05in;
margin-left:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>I regret to inform you that tomorrow¡¯s
settlement conference has been canceled by Varrick Labs. This morning I had a
lengthy phone conversation with Nicholas Walker, chief in-house counsel for
Varrick, during which I was advised that the company has decided to temporarily
postpone settlement negotiations. Their strategy has changed somewhat, especially
in light of the fact that the Klopeck trial is scheduled to begin in Chicago in
four weeks. Varrick now thinks it¡¯s wise to sort of test the waters with an
initial trial, see how the facts play out, determine liability, and roll the
dice with a real jury. While this is not unusual, I had some very harsh words
for Mr. Walker and his company¡¯s rather abrupt change of plans. I suggested
they had negotiated in bad faith, and so on, but there is little to be gained
by arguing at this point. Since we did not quite reach the point of agreeing on
the specifics of a settlement, there is nothing to enforce. It looks as though
all eyes will be on the courtroom in Chicago. I¡¯ll keep you posted. JA</span></p>

<p class=Para19 style='margin-top:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally printed the
e-mail&#8212;it weighed a ton&#8212;walked it into Oscar¡¯s <a name=page257></a>office, and
placed it on his desk. Then he fell into a leather chair and almost began
weeping.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar read it
slowly, the wrinkles across his forehead growing thicker with each sentence. He
was breathing through his mouth, heavily. Rochelle buzzed in with a call for
Oscar, but he did not respond. They heard her heavy footsteps as she walked to
his office door, tapped it, and when neither lawyer responded, she peeked
inside and said, ¡°Mr. Finley, it¡¯s Judge Wilson.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar shook his
head and said, ¡°I can¡¯t talk now. I¡¯ll call him back.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She closed the
door. Minutes passed, then David knocked on the door, came inside, looked at
the two partners, and knew the world was coming to an end. Oscar handed him the
e-mail, which he read as he paced in front of the bookshelves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°There¡¯s more,¡±
David said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What do you mean,
there¡¯s more?¡± Wally asked, his voice weak and dry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I was just online,
looking at a discovery filing, when I saw the notice that a motion had been
filed. Not twenty minutes ago. Jerry Alisandros, on behalf of Zell &amp;
Potter, filed a motion to withdraw as counsel in the Klopeck case.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally¡¯s entire body
slumped a good six inches. Oscar grunted as if trying to say something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David, himself pale
and stunned, continued: ¡°I called my contact at Zell &amp; Potter, guy named
Worley, and he tells me off the record that it¡¯s a full retreat. The
experts&#8212;our experts&#8212;have all collapsed on the drug and no one is willing to
testify. The McFadden report won¡¯t stand up in court. Varrick has known this
for some time and has been stringing out the settlement talks so they could
yank the rug out right before the Klopeck trial. Worley says the Zell &amp;
Potter partners are at war but Alisandros gets the last word. He isn¡¯t coming
to Chicago because he doesn¡¯t want such a notorious loss on his great record.
With no experts, the case is hopeless. Worley says there¡¯s a good chance that
there was nothing wrong with the drug to begin with.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page258></a><span
lang=EN>¡°I knew these cases were a bad idea,¡± Oscar said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh shut up,¡± Wally
hissed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David sat in a wooden
chair as far from the two partners as possible. Oscar had both elbows on his
desk with his head between his forearms, as if in a vice, as if a lethal
migraine were forming. Wally¡¯s eyes were closed and his head twitched. Because
they seemed unable to speak, David felt compelled to attempt conversation. ¡°Can
he withdraw this close to trial?¡± he asked, fully aware that his two partners
knew virtually nothing about the rules of federal court procedure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s up to the
judge,¡± Wally said. ¡°What are they going to do with all their cases?¡± he asked
David. ¡°They have thousands, tens of thousands.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Worley thinks that
everybody will just sit tight and see what happens here, with Klopeck. If we
win, then I guess Varrick will resume settlement talks. If we lose, I guess the
Krayoxx cases are worthless.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The idea of winning
seemed quite remote. Minutes passed with no words. The only sounds were the
labored breathing of three bewildered men. The distant sound of an ambulance
approached on Beech Street, but none of the three reacted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Finally, Wally sat
erect, or tried to, and said, ¡°We¡¯ll have to ask the court for a continuance,
for additional time, and we¡¯ll probably want to oppose this motion to
withdraw.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar managed to
dislodge his head. He glared at Wally as if he could shoot him too. ¡°What you
need to do is call your buddy Jerry and find out what the hell¡¯s going on. He
can¡¯t run away with the trial this close. Tell him we¡¯ll file an ethics
complaint. Tell him we¡¯ll leak it to the press&#8212;the great Jerry Alisandros
afraid to come to Chicago. Tell him anything, Wally, but he has to come try
this case. God knows we can¡¯t do it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°If there¡¯s nothing
wrong with the drug, why even think about going to trial?¡± David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s a bad drug,¡±
Wally said. ¡°And we can find an expert who¡¯ll say so.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°For some reason
I¡¯m having trouble believing you,¡± Oscar said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page259></a><span
lang=EN>David stood and headed for the door. ¡°I suggest we go to our rooms,
think about the situation, and reconvene here in an hour.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally said, ¡°Good
idea,¡± and staggered to his feet. He got to his office, to his phone, and began
calling Alisandros. Not surprisingly, the great man was unavailable. Wally
began sending him e-mails&#8212;long, scorching messages filled with threats and
invective.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David scoured the
blogs&#8212;financial, mass tort, legal watchdogs&#8212;and found confirmation that Varrick
had called off settlement talks. Its share price was down for the third day in
a row.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>By
late afternoon, the firm had filed a motion for a continuance and a response to
Jerry¡¯s motion to withdraw. Virtually all the work was done by David because
Wally had fled the office and Oscar was not functioning well. David had briefed
Rochelle on the disaster, and her first concern was Wally¡¯s drinking. He¡¯d been
sober for almost a year, but she had witnessed his earlier relapses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The following day,
in an unusually prompt move, Nadine Karros filed a response in opposition to
the request for more time. And, in a move that was easily predictable, she had
no problem with Zell &amp; Potter making an exit. A long trial against a pro
like Jerry Alisandros would be a tremendous challenge, but Nadine was confident
she could make quick work of either Finley or Figg, or both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The following day,
in a response that was almost dizzying in its speed, Judge Seawright denied the
request for additional time. The trial had been set for October 17, and it
would go on. He had cleared his calendar for two weeks, and it would be unfair
to other litigants to change the schedule. Mr. Figg had filed the lawsuit
(¡°with as much noise as possible¡±), and he¡¯d had ample time to prepare for
trial. Welcome to the Rocket Docket.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright had
harsh words for Jerry Alisandros but in the end granted his motion to withdraw.
Procedurally, such a motion was almost always granted. The judge noted that the
client, Iris Klopeck, would still have adequate legal representation after the
departure of <a name=page260></a>Mr. Alisandros. The word ¡°adequate¡± could have
been debated, but the judge took the high ground and did not comment on the
complete lack of federal trial experience by Mr. Figg, Mr. Finley, and Mr.
Zinc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The only remaining
option was for Wally to file a motion to dismiss the Klopeck case, along with
the other seven. His fortune was slipping away, and he was close to a nervous
breakdown, but as painful as a dismissal would be, he could not imagine the
horror of walking into Seawright¡¯s courtroom, practically alone, with the
unbearable weight of thousands of Krayoxx victims on his back, and pursuing a
case that even the great trial lawyers were now dodging. No sir. He, along with
what appeared to be everyone else who¡¯d stepped into the pit, was scrambling to
get out of it. Oscar was adamant that the clients should first be notified.
David was of the opinion that Wally should obtain their consent before he killed
their cases. Wally halfheartedly agreed with both, but he could not bring
himself to inform his clients that he was dismissing their cases only days
after he¡¯d sent his jolly letters virtually promising $2 million each.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He was already
working on his lies. He planned to tell Iris, then the rest of them, that
Varrick had successfully managed to get the cases kicked out of federal court
and that he and the other lawyers were considering refiling them in state
court, and this would take time, and so on. Wally needed to burn some clock,
let a few months go by, stall, procrastinate, lie, blame the delays on big bad
Varrick Laboratories. Let the dust settle. Let the dreams of quick money fade
away. After a year or so he would conjure up some more lies, and with the
passage of time all would be forgotten.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He typed the motion
himself, and when it was finished, he stared at it for a long time on his
desktop. Finally, with his door locked and his shoes off, Wally punched the
Send button and said farewell to his fortune.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He needed a drink.
He needed oblivion. Alone, broker than ever, his dreams dashed, his pile of
debts higher, Wally finally cracked and started crying.</span></p>

<p class=0Block style='page-break-before:always'><a name="calibre_pb_0_35"></a><a

CHAPTER_35'><span lang=EN>CHAPTER 35</span></span></h1>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Not so fast, said Ms. Karros. Her prompt and
sharply worded response to what Wally thought was a routine motion to dismiss
was startling. She began by declaring that her client insisted upon a trial.
She went into great detail describing the torrent of bad press Varrick Labs had
endured for over a year&#8212;much of it created and fanned by the plaintiffs¡¯
bar&#8212;and she attached to her motion a binder three inches thick and filled with
press clippings from around the country. Every story was driven by some
loudmouthed lawyer (including Wally) flaying Varrick over Krayoxx and screaming
for millions. It was now grossly unfair to allow these same lawyers to cut and
run without a word of apology to the company.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Her client really
didn¡¯t want an apology; it wanted justice. It demanded a fair trial before a
jury. Varrick Labs didn¡¯t start this fight, but it certainly planned to finish
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Along with her
response she included her own motion, one that had never been seen around the
offices of Finley &amp; Figg. Its title&#8212;Rule 11 Motion for Sanctions&#8212;was
frightening; its language was enough to send Wally back to rehab, David back to
Rogan Rothberg, and Oscar into an early, unfunded retirement. Ms. Karros
argued, quite persuasively, that if the court granted the plaintiff¡¯s motion to
dismiss the case, then the filing of the case was purely frivolous in the first
place. The fact that the plaintiff now wanted to dismiss was a clear sign the
case had no merit and should never have been filed. However, it was <a
name=page262></a>filed, some nine months earlier, and the defendant, Varrick,
had no alternative but to vigorously defend itself. Therefore, under the
sanctions provision of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the
defendant was entitled to be reimbursed for the costs of fighting back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>So far, and Ms.
Karros was blunt about the fact that the meter was still running at full
throttle, Varrick Labs had spent approximately $18 million defending itself,
with at least half of that attributable to the Klopeck case. A huge sum no
doubt, but she was quick to point out that the plaintiff had demanded $100
million when the lawsuit was filed. And given the nature of mass tort
litigation, with all the elements of a stampede, it was, and still is,
imperative that Varrick Labs successfully defend the first trial at all costs.
The law does not require a party to select the cheapest law firm or look for a
bargain. With so much at stake, Varrick Labs wisely chose a law firm with a
long history of success in the courtroom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She went on for
pages giving details of other frivolous cases in which federal judges had
thrown the book at the less than scrupulous lawyers who filed all this junk,
including two from the sacred courtroom of the Honorable Harry L. Seawright.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rule 11 provides
that sanctions, if granted by the court, are to be borne equally by the lawyers
and their client.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Hey, Iris, guess
what? You owe half of $9 million,¡± David mumbled to himself, hoping to find a
bit of humor in another depressing day. He read it first, and by the time he
finished, he was sweating around the neck. Nadine Karros and her small army at
Rogan Rothberg had cranked it out in less than forty-eight hours, and David
could visualize the young grunts pulling all-nighters and sleeping at their
desks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When Wally read it,
he quietly left the office and was not seen for the rest of the day. When Oscar
read it, he shuffled to a small sofa in his locked office, eased off his shoes,
and stretched out, his eyes covered with an arm. After a few minutes, he not
only appeared to be dead; he was actually praying for the end.</span></p>

lang=EN>Bart Shaw was a lawyer who specialized in suing other lawyers for
malpractice. This little niche in the crowded market had earned him the
reputation, among the bar, as a pariah. He had few friends in the profession,
but he had always considered that to be a good thing. He was smart, talented,
and aggressive, just the man Varrick needed for a job that appeared to be a bit
shady but was actually well within ethical guidelines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After a series of
phone conversations with Judy Beck, Nick Walker¡¯s cohort in the legal
department at Varrick, Shaw agreed to the terms of a confidential
representation. His retainer was $25,000 and his hourly rate was $600. Any fees
earned from the potential malpractice cases would be kept by Shaw.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>His first call was
to Iris Klopeck, who, with a month to go before trial, was drifting in and out
of a state that vaguely resembled emotional stability. She wanted no part of a
conversation with another lawyer, a stranger, but did admit she wished she had
never met that other one. After she abruptly hung up, Shaw waited an hour and
tried again. After a cautious ¡°Hello,¡± Shaw plunged in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Are you aware that
your attorney is trying to dismiss your case?¡± he asked. When she couldn¡¯t
respond immediately, he continued. ¡°Ms. Klopeck, my name is Bart Shaw. I¡¯m a
lawyer and I represent people who get screwed by their own lawyers. Legal
malpractice. It¡¯s all I do, and your lawyer, Wally Figg, is trying to weasel
out of your case. I think you may have a lawsuit against him. He has
malpractice insurance coverage and you might be entitled to recover some
money.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ve heard that
somewhere before,¡± she said softly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was Shaw¡¯s game,
and he talked nonstop for the next ten minutes. He described the motion to
dismiss and Wally¡¯s efforts to unload not just her case but seven others as
well. When she finally spoke, she said, ¡°But he promised me a million dollars.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He promised?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh yes.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s highly
unethical, but then I doubt if Mr. Figg worries too much about ethics.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page264></a><span
lang=EN>¡°He¡¯s pretty sleazy,¡± she observed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How, exactly, did
he promise you a million dollars?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Right here at the
kitchen table, first time I laid eyes on him. Then he put it in writing.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He what? You have
it in writing?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Got a letter from

settlement, which was a lot more than the $1 million he had promised. Got the
letter right here. What happened to the settlement? What¡¯s your name again?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Shaw kept her on
the phone for an hour, and both were exhausted when the conversation was over.
Millie Marino was next, and, unmedicated, she grasped the issues much more
quickly than poor Iris. She knew nothing about the collapse of the settlement
plan, or the dismissal, nor had she spoken with Wally in several weeks. As with
Iris, Shaw convinced her to hold off contacting Wally right away. It was more
important for Shaw to do so, at the right moment. Millie was thoroughly
bewildered by the conversation and the turn of events and said she needed some
time to gather her thoughts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Adam Grand needed
no such time. He began cursing Wally immediately. How could the little worm try
to dismiss the case without telling him? Last he heard they were about to
settle for $2 million. Hell yes, Grand was ready to go after Figg. ¡°How much
malpractice insurance coverage does he have?¡± he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The standard
policy is $5 million, but there are many variations,¡± Shaw explained. ¡°We¡¯ll
know soon enough.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The
fifth firm meeting took place after dark on a Thursday night, and Rochelle
skipped it. She could not handle more bad news, and there was nothing she could
do to help the miserable situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The letter from
Bart Shaw had arrived that afternoon and was now lying in the center of the
table. After explaining that he was ¡°in consultation with six of your clients
who were involved in the Krayoxx litigation, including Ms. Iris Klopeck,¡± he
went on to clearly state that <a name=page265></a>he had not been retained by
any of the six. Not yet. They were waiting to see what happened next with their
cases. However, he, Shaw, was gravely concerned with Finley &amp; Figg¡¯s
efforts to unload the cases, and without notifying the clients. Such behavior
breached all manner of professional conduct. In stiff but lucid language, he
lectured the firm on a variety of topics: (1) its ethical duty to diligently
protect its clients¡¯ interests; (2) its duty to keep the clients informed of
all developments; (3) the unethical payment of referral fees to clients; (4)
the outright guarantee of a favorable outcome in order to induce a client to
sign up; and on and on. He sternly warned them that further lapses in their
conduct would lead to unpleasant litigation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar and Wally,
who had survived numerous charges of unethical behavior, were not as bothered
by the allegations as they were terrified of the letter¡¯s overall message; to
wit, the firm would be immediately sued for malpractice if the cases were
dismissed. David was upset over every word in Shaw¡¯s letter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They sat around the
table, all three subdued and thoroughly defeated. There was no cursing or
shouting. David knew the fighting had already taken place when he was away from
the office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There was no way
out. If the Klopeck lawsuit was dismissed, Ms. Karros would castrate them with
her demand for sanctions, and old Seawright would go right along with it. The
firm could face millions in fines. On top of that, this shark Shaw would pile
on with a malpractice claim and drag them through the mud for the next two
years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>If they withdrew
their motion to dismiss, they would be staring at a trial date that was now
only twenty-five days away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>While Wally doodled
on a legal pad as if he were heavily medicated, Oscar did most of the talking.
¡°So, either we get rid of these cases and face financial ruin, or we march into
federal court three weeks from Monday with a case that no lawyer in his right
mind would try before a jury, a case with no liability, no experts, no decent
facts, a client who¡¯s crazy half the time and stoned the other half, a client
whose dead husband weighed 320 pounds and basically ate himself to death, a
veritable platoon of highly paid and very skilled lawyers on the other side
with <a name=page266></a>an unlimited budget and experts from the finest
hospitals in the country, a judge who strongly favors the other side, a judge
who doesn¡¯t like us at all because he thinks we¡¯re inexperienced and
incompetent, and, well, what else? What am I leaving out here, David?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We have no cash
for litigation expenses,¡± David said, but only to complete the checklist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Right. Helluva
job, Wally. As you used to say all the time, these mass tort cases are a gold
mine.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Come on, Oscar,¡±
Wally pleaded softly. ¡°Give me a break. I take full responsibility. It¡¯s all my
fault. Flog me with a bullwhip, whatever. But allow me to suggest we limit our
discussions to something that might be productive, okay, Oscar?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure. What¡¯s your
plan? Dazzle us some more, Wally.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We have no choice
but to go fight,¡± Wally said, his voice still hoarse, his delivery slow. ¡°We
try to piece together some proof. We go to court and fight like hell, and when
we lose we can tell our clients, and this scumbag Shaw, that we fought the good
fight. In every lawsuit, somebody wins, somebody loses. Sure, we¡¯ll get our
butts kicked, but at this point I¡¯d rather walk out of the courtroom with my
head up than deal with sanctions and malpractice claims.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Have you ever
faced a jury in federal court, Wally?¡± Oscar asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No. Have you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No,¡± Oscar said
and looked at David. ¡°Have you, David?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s what I
thought. The three stooges bumbling into the courtroom with the lovely Iris
Klopeck and no clue about what to do next. You mentioned piecing together some
proof. Care to enlighten us, Wally?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally glared at him
for a moment, then said, ¡°We try to find a couple of experts, a cardiologist
and maybe a pharmacologist. There are a lot of experts out there who¡¯ll say
anything for a fee. We pay them, put them on the witness stand, hope like hell
they survive.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°There¡¯s no way
they¡¯ll survive, because they would have to be bogus in the first place.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page267></a><span
lang=EN>¡°Right, but at least we¡¯re trying, Oscar. At least we¡¯re putting up a
fight.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How much do these
quacks cost?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally looked at
David, who said, ¡°I caught up with Dr. Borzov this afternoon, the guy who was
here screening our clients. He¡¯s back home in Atlanta now that the screening
has come to a sudden halt. He said he would consider testifying in the Klopeck
case for a fee of, uh, I think he said $75,000. His accent is pretty thick.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Seventy-five
thousand?¡± Oscar repeated. ¡°And you can¡¯t even understand him?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He¡¯s Russian and
his English is not too refined, which may work to our advantage in a trial
because we might want the jury to be thoroughly confused.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m sorry, you¡¯re
losing me.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, you gotta
figure that Nadine Karros will batter the guy on cross-examination. If the jury
understands how lame he is, then our case is weakened. But if the jury isn¡¯t
sure because they cannot understand him, then maybe, just maybe, the damage is
lessened.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And they taught
you this at Harvard?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I really don¡¯t
remember what they taught me at Harvard.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So how did you
become an expert on trial practice?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m not an expert,
but I am reading a lot, and watching <span class=0Text>Perry Mason</span>
reruns. Sweet little Emma is not sleeping well and I¡¯m roaming around at
night.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I feel better.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally said, ¡°With
some luck, we can find a bogus pharmacologist for $25,000 or so. There will be
a few more expenses, but Rogan has not put up much of a fight.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And now we know
why,¡± Oscar said. ¡°They want a trial, and fast. They want justice. They want a
quick, clear verdict that they can take and broadcast around the world. You
guys fell for their trap, Wally. Varrick started talking settlement, and the
mass tort boys started buying new jets. They strung you along until the first
trial was only a month away, then they pulled the rug. Your close friends at
Zell &amp; <a name=page268></a>Potter hit the back door, and here we are, with
nothing but financial ruin.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯ve had this
conversation, Oscar,¡± Wally said firmly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A thirty-second
time-out was observed as things settled down somewhat. Wally calmly said, ¡°This
building is worth $300,000 and debt free. Let¡¯s go to the bank, put up the
building for a line of credit, cap it at $200,000, and go search for experts.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I was expecting
this,¡± Oscar said. ¡°Why should we throw good money after bad?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Come on, Oscar.
You know more about litigation than I do, which isn¡¯t much, but&#8212;¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re right about
that.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s not enough to
simply walk into court, start the trial, pick a jury, then duck for cover when
Nadine starts firing cannons at us. We won¡¯t even get to the trial if we don¡¯t
find a couple of experts. That in itself is malpractice.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David tried to
help. ¡°You can bet this guy Shaw will be in the courtroom, watching us.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Right,¡± said
Wally. ¡°And if we don¡¯t at least try to put on a case, Seawright might consider
it frivolous and hit us with sanctions. As crazy as it seems, spending some
money might save us a bundle down the road.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar exhaled and
clasped his hands behind his head. ¡°This is insanity. Complete insanity.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally and David
agreed.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally
withdrew his motion to dismiss his cases and sent copies to Bart Shaw for good
measure. Nadine Karros withdrew her response and Rule 11 Motion for Sanctions.
When Judge Seawright signed both orders, the boutique firm of Finley &amp; Figg
breathed easier. For the moment, the three lawyers were not in her gun sights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After reviewing the
firm¡¯s financials, the bank was reluctant to make the loan, even with the
office building free and clear. Unknown <a name=page269></a>to Helen, David
signed a personal guaranty for the line of credit, as did his two partners.
With $200,000 now available, the firm kicked into high gear, which was made
complicated by the fact that none of the three was clear on what needed to be
done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright and
his clerks reviewed the file daily, and with growing concern. On Monday,
October 3, all lawyers were summoned to chambers for an informal update
session. His Honor began the meeting by stating, unequivocally, that the trial
would begin in two weeks and nothing could change this. Both sides claimed to
be ready for trial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Have you retained
experts?¡± he asked Wally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes sir.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And when do you
think you might share this information with the court and with the other side?
You are months past due on this, you know?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, Your Honor,
but we¡¯ve had a few unexpected events in our timeline,¡± Wally said beautifully,
like a real smart-ass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who¡¯s your
cardiologist?¡± Nadine Karros fired from the other side of the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Dr. Igor Borzov,¡±
Wally shot back confidently, as if Borzov were known as the greatest heart
expert in the world. Nadine did not flinch, nor did she smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°When can he be
here for a deposition?¡± the judge asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Whenever,¡± Wally
said. No problem. The truth was that Borzov was having a difficult time making
a decision about walking into a buzz saw, even for $75,000.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We won¡¯t be
deposing Dr. Borzov,¡± Ms. Karros said, quite dismissively. In other words, I
know he¡¯s a quack, don¡¯t care what he says in a depo, because I will annihilate
him in front of the jury. She made this decision on the spot, with no need to
confer with her minions or ponder things for twenty-four hours. Her iciness was
indeed chilling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Do you have a
pharmacologist?¡± she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We do,¡± Wally
lied. ¡°Dr. Herbert Threadgill.¡± Wally had actually spoken to this guy, but no
agreement had been reached. David got his name from his pal Worley at Zell
&amp; Potter, who described Threadgill <a name=page270></a>as ¡°a nut job who¡¯ll
say anything for a buck.¡± But it was proving not to be that easy. Threadgill
was asking for $50,000 to compensate for some of the humiliation he would
undoubtedly face in open court.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We don¡¯t need his deposition
either,¡± she said, with a slight flip of the hand that conveyed a thousand
words. He¡¯ll be dog meat too.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When
the meeting ended, David insisted that Oscar and Wally follow him to a
courtroom on the fourteenth floor of the Dirksen building. According to the
federal court¡¯s Web site, an important trial was getting started. It was a
civil case involving the death of a seventeen-year-old high school senior who¡¯d
been killed instantly when a tractor-trailer rig blew through a red light and
hit the kid broadside. The rig was owned by an out-of-state company, thus the
federal jurisdiction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Since no one at
Finley &amp; Figg had ever tried a case in federal court, David felt strongly
that they should at least watch one.</span></p>

<p class=0Block style='page-break-before:always'><a name="Top_of_part0038_html"></a><a

CHAPTER_36'><span lang=EN>CHAPTER 36</span></span></h1>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Five days before the trial, Judge Seawright
reconvened the lawyers in his courtroom for the final pretrial conference. The
three stooges looked remarkably put together and professional, thanks to
David¡¯s efforts. He had insisted they wear dark suits, white shirts, ties that
were anything but flashy, and black shoes. For Oscar, this had not been a
serious problem since he had always dressed the part of a lawyer, albeit one
from the streets. For David, it was second nature because he had a closet full
of expensive suits from his days at Rogan Rothberg. For Wally, though, it had
been more of a challenge. David found a men¡¯s store with moderately priced
clothing, and he had actually gone with Wally to make selections and supervise
the fitting. Wally had bitched and bickered throughout the ordeal, and he
nearly bolted when the final tally came to $1,400. Eventually, he put it on a
credit card, and he and David both held their breath when the clerk processed
it. The charges cleared, and they hurried away with bags of shirts, ties, and
one pair of black wing tips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On the other side
of the courtroom, Nadine Karros, in Prada, was surrounded by half a dozen of
her attack dogs, all spiffed up in Zegna and Armani suits and looking like ads
from glossy magazines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As was his custom,
Judge Seawright had not released the list of prospective jurors. The other
judges released their lists weeks before trial, and this invariably set in
motion a frenzied investigation by highly paid jury consultants for both sides.
The bigger the case, the more money <a name=page272></a>was spent probing into
the backgrounds of the jury pool. Judge Seawright detested these shadowy
maneuverings. Years earlier, in one of his cases, there had been allegations of
improper contact by investigators. Prospective jurors had complained of being
watched, followed, photographed, and even approached by smooth-talking
strangers who knew too much about them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright
called the meeting to order, and his clerk handed one list to Oscar and another
to Nadine Karros. There were sixty names, all of which had been prescreened by
the judge¡¯s staff to eliminate any juror who (1) was taking or had ever taken
Krayoxx or any other cholesterol medication; (2) had a family member, relative,
or friend who was taking or had ever taken Krayoxx; (3) had ever been represented
by a lawyer remotely connected to the case; (4) had ever been involved in a
lawsuit involving a drug or product alleged to be defective; (5) had read a
newspaper or magazine article about Krayoxx and the litigation surrounding it.
The four-page questionnaire went on to cover other areas that might disqualify
a prospective juror.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In the next five
days, Rogan Rothberg would spend $500,000 delving into the backgrounds of the
jury pool. Once the trial started, they would have three highly paid
consultants scattered around the courtroom observing the jury as it reacted to
the testimony. Finley &amp; Figg¡¯s consultant cost $25,000 and was brought on
board only after another firm fight. She and her associates would do their best
to check backgrounds and profile the model juror, and she would observe the
selection process. Her name was Consuelo, and she quickly realized that she had
never worked with such inexperienced attorneys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It had been
determined, through an unpleasant and often testy process, that Oscar would take
the role of lead counsel and do most of the footwork in the courtroom. Wally
would observe, offer advice, take notes, and do whatever the second-in-command
was supposed to do, though none of them were certain what this would entail.
David would be in charge of the research, a monumental task since this was the
first federal trial for all three and everything had to be researched. Through
the course of numerous arduous strategy sessions around the <a name=page273></a>table,
David had learned that Oscar¡¯s last jury trial had been in state court eight
years earlier, a relatively simple who-ran-the-red-light car accident that he
had lost. Wally¡¯s record was even more modest&#8212;a slip-and-fall case against a
Walmart in which the jury deliberated fifteen minutes before finding for the
store, and an almost forgotten car wreck up in Wilmette that had also ended
badly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When Oscar and
Wally locked horns over strategy, they had turned to David because he was the
only one there. His votes had been crucial, a fact that disturbed him greatly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After the lists
were handed over, Judge Seawright delivered a stern lecture about getting close
to the jury pool. He explained that when the prospective jurors arrived Monday
morning, he would grill them on the subject of improper contact. Did they feel
as if someone had been prying into their lives, their backgrounds? Had they
been followed, photographed? Any violations, and he would be a very unhappy
judge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Moving on, he said,
¡°No <span class=0Text>Daubert</span> challenges have been filed, so it¡¯s safe
to say that neither side wishes to challenge the other¡¯s experts, am I
correct?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Neither Oscar nor
Wally was aware of the <span class=0Text>Daubert</span> rule, which had been
around for years. <span class=0Text>Daubert</span> allowed each side to
challenge the admissibility of the other¡¯s expert testimony. It was standard
procedure in federal cases and was followed in about half of the states. David
had stumbled across it ten days earlier when he was watching a trial down the
hall. After some quick research, he realized that Nadine Karros could probably
exclude their experts before the trial even started. The fact that she had not
requested a <span class=0Text>Daubert</span> hearing meant only one thing&#8212;she
wanted their experts on the stand so she could castigate them before the jury.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After David
explained the rule to his partners, the three made the decision not to file <span
class=0Text>Daubert</span> challenges against the experts for Varrick. Their
reason was as simple as Nadine¡¯s but on the reverse side. Her experts were so
experienced, credentialed, and qualified that a <span class=0Text>Daubert</span>
challenge would be fruitless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page274></a><span
lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s correct, Your Honor,¡± she replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s correct,¡±
Oscar said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Unusual, but then
I¡¯m not looking for any extra work.¡± The judge shuffled some papers and
whispered to a clerk. ¡°I see no pending motions, nothing left to do but start
the trial. The jurors will be here at 8:30 Monday morning and we will begin
promptly at 9:00 a.m. Anything else?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nothing from the
lawyers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Very well. I
commend both sides on an efficient discovery process and unusual cooperation. I
intend to oversee a fair and speedy trial. Court¡¯s adjourned.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The Finley &amp;
Figg team quickly gathered its files and papers and left the courtroom. On the
way out, David tried to imagine what the place would look like in five days,
with sixty prospective and nervous jurors, moles from other mass tort law firms
on hand for a bloodletting, reporters, stock analysts, jury consultants trying
to blend in, smug corporate honchos from Varrick, and the usual courthouse
observers. The knot in his stomach made breathing difficult. ¡°Just survive it,¡±
he kept telling himself. ¡°You¡¯re only thirty-two years old. This will not be
the end of your career.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In the hallway, he
suggested they split up and spend a few hours watching other trials, but Oscar
and Wally just wanted to leave. So David did what he¡¯d been doing for the past
two weeks; he eased into a tense courtroom and took a seat three rows behind
the lawyers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The more he
watched, the more fascinated he became with the art of a trial.</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>In the matter of <span class=0Text>Klopeck v.
Varrick Labs</span>, the first crisis was the failure of the plaintiff to show
up for court. When informed of this in chambers, Judge Seawright was less than
pleased. Wally tried to explain that Iris had been rushed to the hospital in
the middle of the night, complaining of shortness of breath, hyperventilation,
hives, and one or two other afflictions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Three hours
earlier, as the Finley &amp; Figg lawyers worked frantically around the table
in a predawn session, a call came on Wally¡¯s cell. It was Bart Shaw, the
malpractice lawyer who was threatening to sue if the Krayoxx cases were
mishandled. Apparently, Iris¡¯s son, Clint, had found a lawyer¡¯s phone number
and called to say his mother was in the ambulance and headed for the hospital.
She would not be able to attend the trial. Clint had called the wrong lawyer,
and Shaw was just passing along the news.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Gee thanks,
asshole,¡± Wally had said as he punched the disconnect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°When did you first
learn that she was taken to the hospital?¡± Judge Seawright was now asking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A few hours ago,
Judge. We were at the office preparing, and her lawyer called.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Her lawyer? I
thought you were her lawyer.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David and Oscar
wanted to slide under the table. Wally¡¯s brain was already fried and he had
taken two sedatives. He looked upward at the ceiling and tried to think of a quick
way out of this blunder. ¡°Yes, well, <a name=page276></a>you see, Judge, it¡¯s
complicated. But she¡¯s at the hospital. I¡¯ll go see her during the lunch
break.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Across the table,
Nadine Karros maintained a look of casual concern. She knew everything about
Bart Shaw¡¯s bullying of Finley &amp; Figg. In fact, she and her associates had
located Shaw and recommended him to Nicholas Walker and Judy Beck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You do that, Mr.
Figg,¡± Seawright said sternly. ¡°And I want to see some report from her doctors.
I suppose if she¡¯s unable to testify, then we¡¯ll be forced to use her
deposition.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes sir.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Jury selection
should move right along. I anticipate seating the jury by late this afternoon,
so you¡¯re first up in the morning, Mr. Figg. Ideally, the plaintiff begins its
case by taking the stand and talking about the dearly departed.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was certainly
thoughtful of Judge Seawright to tell them how to try their case, Wally
thought, but his tone was condescending.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll talk to her
doctors,¡± Wally said again. ¡°That¡¯s the best I can do.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Anything else?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>All the lawyers
shook their heads, then left the chambers. They filed into the courtroom, which
had filled up nicely in the past fifteen minutes. To the left, behind the
plaintiff¡¯s counsel table, a bailiff was herding the sixty jurors into the
long, padded benches. To the right, several groups of spectators were milling
about, waiting, whispering. Seated near the back, together, were Millie Marino,
Adam Grand, and Agnes Schmidt, three of Finley &amp; Figg¡¯s other victims,
present out of curiosity and perhaps looking for answers since their guaranteed
$1 million jackpots had suddenly vanished. They were with Bart Shaw, the
vulture, the pariah, the lowest scum to be found in the legal profession. Two
rows in front of them sat Goodloe Stamm, the divorce lawyer hired by Paula
Finley. Stamm had already heard the gossip and knew the serious trial lawyers
had jumped ship. Still, he was curious about the case and even hopeful Finley
&amp; Figg could pull off a miracle and generate some money for his client.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page277></a><span
lang=EN>Judge Seawright called things to order and thanked the jurors for their
patriotic duty. He gave a thirty-word summary of the case, then introduced the
lawyers and the courtroom personnel who would take part in the trial&#8212;the court
reporter, the bailiffs, the clerks. He explained the absence of Iris Klopeck
and introduced Nicholas Walker, the corporate representative for Varrick
Laboratories.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After thirty years
on the bench, Harry Seawright knew a thing or two about selecting juries. The
most important element, at least in his opinion, was to keep the lawyers as
quiet as possible. He had his own list of questions, one tweaked over the
years, and allowed the lawyers to submit inquiries to him. But he did the bulk
of the talking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The extensive
screening questionnaire streamlined the process. It had already eliminated
jurors who were over sixty-five, blind, or suffering from a disability that
would affect their service, and those who had served in the past twelve months.
It had flagged those who claimed to know something about the case, or the
lawyers, or the drug. As the judge went through his questions, an airline pilot
stood and asked to be excused because of his schedule. This prompted a
surprisingly harsh lecture from Judge Seawright about civic duty. When the pilot
sat down, adequately scorched, no one else dared to claim they were too busy to
serve. A young mother with a Down¡¯s child was excused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In the previous two
weeks, David had talked to at least a dozen lawyers who had tried cases before
Seawright. Every judge has his quirks, especially federal ones because they are
appointed for life and their actions are seldom questioned. Every lawyer had
told David to just lie low during jury selection. ¡°The old man will do a
thorough job for you,¡± they said, over and over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When the pool was
down to fifty, Judge Seawright picked twelve names at random. They were
directed by a bailiff to the jury box, where they filled the comfortable
chairs. Every lawyer was scribbling away. The jury consultants were on the
edges of their seats, practically gawking at the first twelve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The great debate
had been, what¡¯s the model juror for this case? On the plaintiff¡¯s side, the
lawyers preferred heavy people with habits as <a name=page278></a>slovenly as
the Klopecks¡¯, preferably folks battling high cholesterol and other
lifestyle-inflicted health problems. Across the aisle, the defense lawyers
preferred lean, hard, youthful bodies with little patience and sympathy for the
obese and afflicted. In the first batch, there was the inevitable mix, though
only a couple appeared to spend much time in the gym. Judge Seawright zeroed in
on Number 35 because she had admitted reading several articles about the drug.
However, it became clear that she was open-minded and could be fair. Number
29¡¯s father was a doctor, and she grew up in a house where ¡°lawsuit¡± was a
dirty word. Number 16 had once filed a lawsuit over a bad roofing job, and this
was discussed to the point of forcing yawns. But the judge plowed ahead with
his endless questions. When he finished, he invited the plaintiff to quiz the
prospective jurors, but only on topics that had not been covered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar walked to the
podium, which had been turned to face the jury box. He offered a warm smile and
said good morning to the jurors. ¡°I have just a couple of questions,¡± he said
softly, as if he had done this many times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Since the eventful
day David Zinc had stumbled, literally, into the offices of Finley &amp; Figg,
Wally had said on numerous occasions that Oscar was not easily intimidated.
Perhaps it was his rough childhood, his days as a tough street cop, or his long
career representing freaked-out spouses and injured workers, or maybe it was
just his pugnacious, Irish composition, but whatever the mix Oscar Finley had a
very thick skin. Perhaps, too, it was the Valium, but when Oscar chatted with
the twelve potential jurors, he managed to hide the jitters and nerves and
outright fear and convey an air of calm and confidence. He asked a few benign
questions, solicited a few feeble responses, then sat down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The firm had taken
a first baby step in court without a disaster, and David relaxed a little. He
was comforted by the fact that he was third down the line&#8212;not that he had much
confidence in the two in front of him&#8212;but at least they were on the firing line
and he was partially hidden back in the trenches. He refused to glance over at
the gang from Rogan Rothberg, and they seemed genuinely unconcerned about him. <a
name=page279></a>This was game day and they were the players. They knew they
would win. David and his partners were going through the motions, stuck with a
case that no one wanted, and dreaming of the end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine Karros
addressed the potential jurors and introduced herself. There were five men and
seven women in the jury box. The men, ages twenty-three to sixty-three, sized
her up and approved. David concentrated on the women¡¯s faces. It was Helen¡¯s
theory that the women would have mixed and complicated feelings about Nadine
Karros. First, and most important, there would be pride that a woman was not
only in charge but, as they would soon realize, also the best lawyer in the
courtroom. For some, though, the pride would soon yield to envy. How could one
woman be so beautiful, stylish, thin, yet intelligent and successful in a man¡¯s
world?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The first
impressions were generally good, judging from the faces of the women. The men
were all in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine¡¯s questions
were more involved. She talked about lawsuits, the culture of litigation in our
society, and the routine news of outrageous verdicts. Did this ever bother any
of the jurors? For a few, yes, and so she probed deeper. Number 8¡¯s husband was
a union electrician, generally a safe bet for any plaintiff suing a large
corporation, and Nadine seemed to take a special interest in her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The Finley &amp;
Figg lawyers watched Nadine carefully. Her striking appearance would probably
be the only highlight of the trial for them, and even that would get old.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After two hours,
Judge Seawright ordered a thirty-minute recess so the lawyers could compare
notes, meet with their consultants, and start making selections. Each side
could assert that any juror should be excluded for good cause. For example, if
a juror claimed to be biased for some reason, or had once been represented by
one of the law firms, or claimed to hate Varrick, then the juror would be excused
for good cause. Beyond that, each side had three peremptory challenges that
could be used to exclude a juror for any reason, or no reason.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After thirty
minutes, both sides requested more time, and Judge Seawright adjourned the
proceedings until 2:00 p.m. ¡°I assume you <a name=page280></a>will check on
your client, Mr. Figg,¡± he said. Wally assured him that he would.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Outside the
courtroom, Oscar and Wally quickly decided that David would be sent to find
Iris and determine if she was able, and willing, to testify first thing Tuesday
morning. According to Rochelle, who had spent the morning haggling on the phone
with hospital receptionists, Iris had been taken to the emergency room at
Christ Medical Center. When David arrived there at noon, he learned that she
had left an hour earlier. He raced away, in the direction of her home near
Midway Airport, and he and Rochelle called her home number every ten minutes.
There was no answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The same monstrous
orange cat was curled up at the front door, one sleepy eye watching David as he
cautiously approached along the sidewalk. He remembered the barbecue grill on
the front porch. He remembered the aluminum foil covering the windows. He had
made this same walk ten months earlier, the day after his escape from Rogan
Rothberg, following Wally and wondering if he¡¯d lost his mind. He now asked
himself that again, but there was little time for navel-gazing. He banged on
the front door and waited for the cat to either move or attack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who is it?¡± came a
male voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°David Zinc. Your
lawyer. Is that you, Clint?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was. Clint
opened the door and said, ¡°What are you doing here?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m here because
your mother is not in court. We¡¯re in the process of picking a jury, and there
is a federal judge who¡¯s somewhat upset because Iris skipped court this morning.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Clint waved him in.
Iris was laid up on the sofa, under a stained and tattered quilt, eyes closed,
a beached whale. The coffee table next to her was covered in gossip magazines,
an empty pizza box, empty bottles of diet soda, and three jars of prescription
drugs. ¡°How is she?¡± David whispered, though he had a general idea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Clint shook his
head gravely. ¡°Not good,¡± he said, as if she would die any minute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page281></a><span
lang=EN>David backed into a dirty chair covered in orange cat fur. He had no
time to waste and despised being there anyway. ¡°Iris, can you hear me?¡± he said
at full volume.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes,¡± she answered
without opening her eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Listen, the trial
is under way, and the judge really needs to know if you plan to show up
tomorrow. We need you to testify and tell the jury about Percy. It¡¯s sort of
your job as the representative of his estate and spokesman for the family, you
know?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She grunted and
exhaled, a painful racket that came from deep in her lungs. ¡°Didn¡¯t want this
lawsuit,¡± she said, her words slurred. ¡°That creep Figg came here and talked me
into it. Promised me a million dollars.¡± She managed to open her right eye and
attempted to look at David. ¡°You came with him, now I remember. I was just
sitting here minding my own business, and Figg promised me all that money.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Her right eye
closed. David pressed on: ¡°You saw a doctor this morning at the hospital. What
did he say? What¡¯s your condition?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You name it.
Mainly nerves. I can¡¯t go to court. Might kill me.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The obvious finally
occurred to David. Their case, if it could still be called that, would be
damaged even more if Iris made an appearance before the jury. The rules of
procedure allowed that in the event a witness cannot testify for some
reason&#8212;death, sickness, imprisonment&#8212;the deposition could be edited and presented
to the jury. As weak as her depo was, nothing could be as bad as Iris live and
in person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What¡¯s your
doctor¡¯s name?¡± David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Which one?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t know, pick
one. The one you saw this morning at the hospital.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I didn¡¯t see one
this morning. Got tired of waiting at the emergency room, and so Clint brought
me home.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s about five
times in the past month,¡± Clint said, with an edge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not so,¡± she fired
back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She does it all
the time,¡± Clint explained to David. ¡°She¡¯ll walk to <a name=page282></a>the
kitchen, claim she¡¯s tired and short of breath, next thing you know she¡¯s on
the phone calling 911. I¡¯m pretty sick of it, myself. It¡¯s always me who has to
drive to the damn hospital and haul her back here.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, well,¡± Iris
said, both eyes open, glazed but angry. ¡°He was a lot nicer when all that money
was on the way. Couldn¡¯t have been sweeter. Now look at him, beating up his
poor sick momma.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Just stop calling
911,¡± Clint said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Are you going to
testify tomorrow?¡± David asked firmly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, I can¡¯t. I
can¡¯t leave this house, otherwise my nerves will melt down.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It won¡¯t do any
good, will it?¡± Clint asked. ¡°The lawsuit is a loser. That other lawyer, Shaw,
says you guys have messed up the case so bad can¡¯t nobody win it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David was about to
return fire when he realized that Clint was right. The lawsuit was a loser.
Thanks to Finley &amp; Figg, the Klopecks were now in federal court with a case
that was hopeless, and he along with his partners was simply going through the
motions and looking forward to the end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David said good-bye
and left as quickly as possible. Clint followed him outside, and as they walked
to the street, he said, ¡°Look, if you need me, I¡¯ll come to court and speak for
the family.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>If an appearance by
Iris was the last thing their case needed, a cameo by Clint was certainly next
to last. ¡°Let me think about it,¡± David said, but only to be nice. The jury
would get more than enough of the Klopecks through Iris¡¯s video deposition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Any chance we¡¯re
gonna get some money?¡± Clint asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯re fighting,
Clint. There¡¯s always a chance, but no guarantees.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure would be
nice.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At
4:30, the jury was selected, seated, sworn, and sent home with instructions to
return at 8:45 the following morning. Of the twelve, there were seven women,
five men, eight whites, three blacks, and one Hispanic, though the jury
consultants felt as if race would not be a factor. <a name=page283></a>One
woman was moderately obese. The rest were in reasonably good shape. Their ages
ranged from twenty-five to sixty-one, all had finished high school, and three
had college degrees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The Finley &amp;
Figg lawyers piled into David¡¯s SUV and headed back to the office. They were
exhausted, but oddly satisfied. They had gone toe-to-toe with the power of
corporate America and, so far, had not crumbled under the pressure. Of course,
the trial hadn¡¯t really started. No witness had been sworn. No evidence had
been offered. The worst was yet to come, but for the moment they were still in
the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David gave a
detailed account of his visit to see Iris, and all three agreed she should be
kept away from the courtroom. Their first task of the evening was to somehow
obtain a letter from a doctor that would satisfy Seawright.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There was much to
be done that evening. They bought a pizza and took it to the office.</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Monday¡¯s brief respite from the fear of
annihilation was long forgotten by Tuesday morning. By the time the boutique
team walked into the courtroom, the pressure was back in spades. This was the
real beginning of the trial, and a heavy tension filled the air. ¡°Just get
through it,¡± David repeated each time his stomach turned flips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright
offered an abrupt good morning, welcomed his jury, then explained, or tried to
explain, the absence of Ms. Iris Klopeck, widow and personal representative of Percy
Klopeck. When he finished, he said, ¡°At this time, each party will make an
opening statement. Nothing you are about to hear is evidence; rather, it¡¯s what
the lawyers think they will prove during this trial. I caution you to take it
lightly. You may proceed, Mr. Finley, for the plaintiff.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar stood and
walked to the podium with his yellow legal pad. He placed it on the podium,
smiled at the jurors, looked at his notes, smiled again at the jurors, then,
oddly, stopped smiling. Several awkward seconds passed, as if Oscar had lost
his train of thought and could think of nothing to say. He wiped his forehead
with the palm of his hand and fell forward. He ricocheted off the podium and
landed hard on the carpeted floor, still groaning and grimacing as if in
enormous pain. There was a wild scramble as Wally and David sprinted for him,
as did two uniformed bailiffs and a couple of the Rogan Rothberg attorneys.
Several of the jurors stood as if they wanted to help in some <a name=page285></a>way.
Judge Seawright was yelling, ¡°Call 911! Call 911!¡± Then, ¡°Is there a doctor
here?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>No one claimed to
be a doctor. One of the bailiffs took charge, and it wasn¡¯t long before it was
clear that Oscar had not merely fainted. In the chaos, and as a crowd hovered
over Oscar, someone said, ¡°He¡¯s barely breathing.¡± There was more scurrying
about, more calls for help. A paramedic assigned to the courthouse arrived
within minutes and knelt over Oscar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally stood and
backed away and found himself near the jury box. Without thinking, and in an
incredibly stupid effort at humor, he looked at the jurors, pointed to his
fallen partner, and said, in a voice that was heard by many, words that would
be repeated by other lawyers for years to come, ¡°Oh, the wonders of Krayoxx.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Your Honor,
please!¡± Nadine Karros shrieked. Several of the jurors found it funny; others
did not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright
said, ¡°Mr. Figg, get away from the jury.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally scampered
away. He and David waited across the courtroom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The jury was
removed and sent back to the jury room. ¡°Court¡¯s in recess for an hour,¡±
Seawright said. He walked down from the bench and waited near the podium. Wally
eased over and said, ¡°Sorry about that, Judge.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Silence.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A team of
paramedics arrived with a stretcher. Oscar was strapped down and wheeled out of
the courtroom. He did not appear to be conscious. He had a pulse, but it was
dangerously low. As the lawyers and spectators mingled about, uncertain as to
what they should be doing, David whispered to Wally, ¡°Any history of heart
trouble?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally shook his
head. ¡°Nothing. He¡¯s always been lean and healthy. Seems like his father may

lang=EN>Fearing that he was on the hot seat, Wally decided he had nothing to
lose. He went into Judge Seawright¡¯s chambers with an attitude. ¡°Judge, I need
to get to the hospital.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Just a moment, Mr.
Figg.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine was standing
and not happy. She said, in her best courtroom voice, ¡°Your Honor, based solely
on the improper comments made by Mr. Figg directly to the jurors, we have no
choice but to move for a mistrial.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Mr. Figg?¡± His
Honor demanded in a tone that clearly conveyed the message that a mistrial was
only minutes, perhaps seconds away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was standing
too and could think of no response. David instinctively said, ¡°How is the jury
prejudiced? Mr. Finley did not take the drug. Sure, it was a stupid comment,
made in the chaos of the moment, but there is no prejudice.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I disagree, Your
Honor,¡± Nadine shot back. ¡°Several of the jurors thought it was funny and were
actually on the verge of laughing. Calling it stupid is an understatement. It
was clearly an improper and very prejudicial comment.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A mistrial would
mean a delay, something that the plaintiff¡¯s team needed. Hell, they were
willing to delay it for a decade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Motion granted,¡±
His Honor announced. ¡°I declare a mistrial. Now what?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally had fallen
into a chair and looked pale. David said the first thing that came to his mind.
¡°Well, Judge, we obviously need more time. How about a continuance or something
like that?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Ms. Karros?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Judge, this is
certainly a unique situation. I suggest we wait twenty-four hours and monitor
Mr. Finley¡¯s condition. I think it¡¯s fair to point out that Mr. Figg filed this
lawsuit and was lead counsel until just a few days ago. I¡¯m sure he could try
this case as well as his senior partner.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good point,¡± Judge
Seawright agreed. ¡°Mr. Zinc, I think it best <a name=page287></a>if you and Mr.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Will do, Judge.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar
suffered acute myocardial infarction. He was stable and expected to survive,
but the early scans revealed substantial blockage in three coronary arteries.
David and Wally spent a miserable day in the ICU waiting room at the hospital,
killing time, talking trial strategy, e-mailing Judge Seawright, eating food
from a machine, and walking the halls out of boredom. Wally was certain that
neither Paula Finley nor their daughter, Keely, was at the hospital. Oscar had
moved out three months earlier and was already seeing someone else, on the sly
of course. There were rumors that Paula had also found someone new. At any
rate, the marriage was happily over with, though the divorce had a ways to go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At 4:30, a nurse
led them to Oscar¡¯s bed for a brief hello. He was awake, thoroughly covered
with tubes and monitors, and breathing on his own. ¡°Great opening statement,¡±
Wally said and got a weak smile in return. They were not about to mention the
mistrial. After a few awkward efforts at conversation, they realized Oscar was
too fatigued to chat, so they said good-bye and left. On the way out, a nurse
informed them that surgery was scheduled for 7:00 the following morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At 6:00 the
following morning, David, Wally, and Rochelle surrounded Oscar¡¯s bed for a
final round of well-wishing before he went to the OR. When a nurse asked them
to leave, they went to the cafeteria for a hearty breakfast of watery eggs and
cold bacon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What happens to
the trial?¡± Rochelle asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David gnawed a
piece of bacon and eventually replied, ¡°Not sure, but I have a hunch we won¡¯t
be getting much of a continuance.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was stirring
his coffee and observing two young nurses. ¡°And it looks like we¡¯re both
getting promotions. I¡¯ll have the lead, and you¡¯re getting moved to the second
chair.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page288></a><span
lang=EN>¡°So the show goes on?¡± Rochelle asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh yes,¡± David
said. ¡°We have very little control over what¡¯s happening now. Varrick is
calling the shots. The company wants a trial because the company wants
vindication. A huge victory. Headlines. Proof that its wonderful drug is not so
bad after all. And, most important, the judge is clearly on their side.¡±
Another bite of bacon. ¡°So, they have the facts, the money, the experts, the
legal talent, and the judge.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What do we have?¡±
she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Both lawyers
thought about that for a while, then both began shaking their heads. Nothing.
We have nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I guess we have
Iris,¡± Wally finally said and got a laugh. ¡°Lovely Iris.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And she¡¯s gonna
testify in front of the jury?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No. One of her
doctors e-mailed a letter saying she is physically unable to testify in court,¡±
David said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thank God for
that,¡± Wally said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After an hour of
killing time, the three voted unanimously to return to the office and try to
pursue something productive. David and Wally had a dozen things to do for the
trial. A nurse called at 11:30 with the welcome news that Oscar was out of
surgery and doing well. He could not see visitors for twenty-four hours, which
was also well received. David e-mailed the latest update to Judge Seawright¡¯s
clerk and fifteen minutes later got a reply requiring all lawyers to be in his
chambers at 2:00 p.m.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Please
give my regards to Mr. Finley,¡± His Honor said indifferently as soon as the
lawyers were seated, David and Wally on one side and Nadine and four of her
henchmen on the other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thanks, Judge,¡±
Wally said, but only because a response was required.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Our new plan is as
follows,¡± Seawright said without breaking stride. ¡°There are thirty-four jurors
left in the pool. I will summon <a name=page289></a>them back Friday morning,
October 21, three days from today, and we will select a new jury. Next Monday,
October 24, we will start the retrial. Any comments or concerns?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oh, lots of them,
Wally wanted to say. But where should I begin?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nothing from the
lawyers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The judge
continued: ¡°I realize this does not give the plaintiff¡¯s lawyers much time to
regroup, but I¡¯m convinced that Mr. Figg will do as well as Mr. Finley.
Frankly, neither has any experience in federal court. Substituting one for the
other will not damage the plaintiff¡¯s case in any way.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We are ready for
trial,¡± Wally said loudly, but only to retaliate and defend himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good. Now, Mr.
Figg, I will not tolerate any more of your ridiculous comments in court,
regardless of whether the jury is present.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I apologize, Your
Honor,¡± Wally said with a phoniness that was obvious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And your apology
is accepted. However, I am levying a fine of $5,000 against you and your firm
for such reckless and unprofessional behavior in my courtroom, and I¡¯ll do it
again if you step out of line.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s a bit
steep,¡± Wally blurted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>So the hemorrhaging
continues, David thought to himself. Seventy-five thousand to Dr. Borzov; $50,000
to Dr. Herbert Threadgill, their expert pharmacologist; $15,000 to Dr. Kanya
Meade, their expert economist; $25,000 to Consuelo, their jury consultant.
Throw in another $15,000 to get all the experts to Chicago, feed them, put them
up in nice hotels, and Iris Klopeck and her dead husband were costing Finley
&amp; Figg at least $180,000. Now, thanks to Wally¡¯s big mouth, they had just
lost another $5,000.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Bear in mind, David
kept telling himself, this was supposedly cheap money being thrown up as a
defense. Otherwise, they would be sued for malpractice and face some rather
terrifying sanctions for filing such a frivolous case. In effect, they were
burning serious cash to make their frivolous case appear less frivolous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page290></a><span
lang=EN>Such maneuverings had never been mentioned during law school at
Harvard, nor had he ever heard of such insanity during his five years at Rogan
Rothberg.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On the subject of
sanctions, Ms. Karros took charge and said, ¡°Your Honor, this is a Rule 11
motion we are filing at this time.¡± Copies were slid across the table as she
continued, ¡°We are requesting sanctions on the grounds that Mr. Figg¡¯s reckless
actions in court yesterday caused a mistrial, resulting in unnecessary expense
to our client. Why should Varrick Labs pay for the plaintiff¡¯s unprofessional
behavior?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally shot back,
¡°Because Varrick has a book value of $48 billion. My net worth is substantially
less.¡± Humorous, but no laughs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright
read the motion carefully, and when David and Wally realized this, they began
reading too. After ten minutes of silence, the judge said, ¡°Your response, Mr.
Figg?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally tossed his
copy of the motion onto the table as if it were filthy. ¡°You know, Judge, I
can¡¯t help the fact that these guys charge a zillion dollars an hour. They are
obscenely expensive, but that should not be my problem. If Varrick wants to
burn its cash, then it certainly has plenty to burn. But don¡¯t get me in the
middle of it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You miss the
point, Mr. Figg,¡± Nadine replied. ¡°We wouldn¡¯t be doing the extra work if not
for you and the mistrial you created.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But $35,000? Come
on. Do you people really think you¡¯re that valuable?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Depends on the
outcome of the trial, Mr. Figg. When you filed this lawsuit you asked for,
what, a hundred million or so? Don¡¯t criticize my client for putting up a
vigorous defense with good legal talent.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So, let me get
this straight. During this trial, if you and your client do something to sort
of string things along, you know, drag out the trial, God forbid make a
mistake, anything like that, then I can file a quick motion for sanctions and
collect some money? Am I right about this, Judge?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No. That would be
a frivolous motion, subject to Rule 11.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Of course it
would!¡± Wally said with a belly laugh. ¡°You guys make a great tag team.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page291></a><span
lang=EN>¡°Watch it, Mr. Figg,¡± Judge Seawright growled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Knock it off,¡±
David whispered. A few seconds of silence followed as Wally settled down.
Finally, the judge said, ¡°I agree that the mistrial could have been avoided,
and that it has caused additional expense. However, I think $35,000 is somewhat
on the excessive end. Sanctions are in order, but not to that extent. Ten
thousand dollars is a more reasonable sum. It is so ordered.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally
exhaled&#8212;another shot to the gut. David¡¯s next thought was to try to speed
things along so the meeting could come to a merciful end. Finley &amp; Figg
couldn¡¯t afford much more. He offered a lame ¡°Judge, we need to get back to the
hospital.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Adjourned, until
Friday morning.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>The second jury was comprised of seven men and
five women. Of the twelve, half were white, three were black, two were Asian,
one was Hispanic. It was slightly more blue-collar and slightly heavier as a
whole. Two of the men were uncomfortably obese. Nadine Karros had decided to
use her peremptory challenges to exclude fatties instead of minorities, but she
had been overwhelmed by the sheer abundance of girth. Consuelo was convinced
that this jury was far more to their liking than the first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Monday morning, as
Wally stood and made his way to the podium, David held his breath. He was on
deck, and another heart attack would force him into the lineup against
overwhelming competition. He was pulling mightily for the junior partner.
Though Wally had lost a few pounds frolicking with DeeAnna, he was still pudgy
and unkempt. As far as heart attacks go, he appeared to be a much likelier
candidate than Oscar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Come on, Wally, you
can do it. Give ¡¯em hell and please don¡¯t collapse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He did not. He did
a passable job of outlining their case against Varrick Labs, the third-largest
drugmaker in the world, a ¡°mammoth corporation¡± based in New Jersey, a company
with a long, deplorable history of littering the market with bad drugs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Objection by Ms.
Karros. Sustained from the bench.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>But Wally was
careful, and with good reason. When a stray word <a name=page293></a>or two can
cost you upward of $10,000, you tiptoe lightly around anything you¡¯re not sure
of. He repeatedly referred to the medicine not as Krayoxx but rather as ¡°this
bad drug.¡± He rambled at times but for the most part stayed on script. When he
finished thirty minutes after he started, David was breathing again and
whispered, ¡°Nice job.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine Karros
wasted no time in defending her client and its product. She began with a
lengthy, detailed, but quite interesting list of all the fabulous drugs Varrick
Labs had brought to the market over the past fifty years, drugs that every
American knew and trusted, and some that most had never heard of. Drugs that we
give to our children. Drugs we consume with confidence every day. Drugs
synonymous with good health. Drugs that prolong lives, kill infections, prevent
diseases, and so on. From sore throats and headaches to cholera outbreaks and
AIDS epidemics, Varrick Labs had been on the front lines for decades, and the
world was a better, safer, and healthier place because of it. By the time she
finished with Act One, many of those in the courtroom would have taken a bullet
for Varrick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Switching gears,
she dwelled on the drug at hand, Krayoxx, a drug so effective that it was
prescribed by doctors&#8212;¡°your doctors¡±&#8212;more than any other cholesterol drug in
the world. She detailed the extensive research that had gone into developing
Krayoxx. Somehow, she made clinical trials sound interesting. Study after study
had proven the drug to be not only effective but safe. Her client had spent $4
billion and eight years researching and developing Krayoxx, and it stood
proudly behind this wonderful product.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Without staring,
David watched the faces of the jurors. All twelve followed every word. All
twelve were becoming believers. David himself was being persuaded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She talked about
the experts she would call to testify. Eminent scholars and researchers, from
such places as Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and Harvard Medical School. These
men and women had spent years studying Krayoxx and knew it far better than the
¡°lightweights¡± the plaintiff would present.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wrapping up, she
was confident that when all the proof had been <a name=page294></a>heard, they,
the jurors, would have no trouble understanding and believing there was
absolutely nothing wrong with Krayoxx, and they would retire and reach a quick
verdict for her client, Varrick Laboratories.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David watched the
seven men as she walked away. All fourteen eyes followed her closely. He
glanced at his watch&#8212;fifty-eight minutes&#8212;and the time had flown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Two large screens
were erected by technicians, and as they worked, Judge Seawright explained to
the jury they were about to watch the deposition of the plaintiff, Ms. Iris
Klopeck, who could not attend due to health reasons. Her deposition had been
taken and recorded by video on March 30 in a hotel in downtown Chicago. The
judge assured the jury this was not unusual and should not influence their
opinion in any way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The lights were
dimmed, and suddenly there was Iris, much larger than life, frowning at the
camera, frozen, clueless, stoned. The depo had been heavily edited to remove
what was objectionable and the squabbles between the lawyers. After breezing
through all the background material, Iris got to the topic of Percy. His role
as a father, his work history, his habits, his death. Exhibits were offered and
flashed onto the screen: a photo of Iris and Percy splashing in the water with
little Clint, both parents already morbidly obese; another photo of Percy at
the grill with friends around, all preparing to devour bratwurst and burgers on
July 4; another of him sitting in a rocker with that orange cat in his
lap&#8212;rocking, it seemed, was his only exercise. The images soon ran together and
formed a picture of Percy that was accurate but not pretty. He¡¯d been a very
large man who ate too much, never broke a sweat, was a slob, died too young,
with the cause of death fairly obvious. At times, Iris became emotional. At
times, she was practically incoherent. The video did little to arouse sympathy.
But as her trial team knew so well, it was a much better presentation than
having her there in person. Edited, it ran for eighty-seven minutes, and
everyone in the courtroom was relieved when it was over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When the lights came
on, Judge Seawright declared it was time for <a name=page295></a>lunch and they
would reconvene at 2:00 p.m. Without a word, Wally vanished with the crowd. He
and David had planned to have a quick sandwich in the building and plot
strategy, but David gave up after fifteen minutes and left to eat alone in the
caf&eacute; on the second floor of the building.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar was out of
the hospital and convalescing in Wally¡¯s apartment. Rochelle checked on him
twice a day&#8212;still no sign of his wife or daughter. David called him with a
brief update on the start of the trial and put a positive spin on things. Oscar
feigned interest, but it was obvious he was happy to be where he was.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At
2:00 p.m., the courtroom came to order. The bloodletting was about to begin,
and Wally seemed remarkably at ease. ¡°Call your next witness,¡± the judge said,
and Wally reached for his notepad. ¡°This will be ugly,¡± he whispered, and David
caught the unmistakable odor of freshly consumed beer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Dr. Igor Borzov was
led to the witness stand, where the bailiff presented a Bible to help with the
swearing in. Borzov looked at the Bible and began shaking his head. He refused
to touch it. Judge Seawright asked if there was a problem, and Borzov said
something about being an atheist. ¡°No Bible,¡± he said. ¡°I don¡¯t believe it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David watched in
horror. Come on, you quack, for a $75,000 fee the least you can do is play
along. After an awkward delay, Judge Seawright told the bailiff to lose the
Bible. Borzov raised his right hand and swore to tell the truth, but by then
the jury had already been lost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Working from a
carefully worded script, Wally led him through the rituals of qualifying an
expert. Education&#8212;college and med school in Moscow. Training&#8212;a residency in
cardiology in Kiev, a couple of hospitals in Moscow. Experience&#8212;a brief stint
on staff at a community hospital in Fargo, North Dakota, and private practice
in Toronto and Nashville. The night before, Wally and David had rehearsed with
him for hours, and they had pleaded with him to speak as slowly and <a
name=page296></a>clearly as possible. In the privacy of their office, Borzov
was somewhat comprehensible. On center stage, though, and in a tense courtroom,
Borzov forgot their pleas and delivered his rapid-fire responses in an accent
so thick it barely resembled English. Twice the court reporter called time-out
for clarification.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Court reporters are
brilliant in their ability to digest mumblings, speech impediments, accents,
slang, and technical vocabulary. The fact that she couldn¡¯t follow Borzov was
devastating. The third time she interrupted, Judge Seawright said, ¡°I can¡¯t
understand him either. Do you have an interpreter, Mr. Figg?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Thanks, Judge.
Several of the jurors were amused by the question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally and David had
actually discussed the hiring of a Russian interpreter, but that discussion had
been part of a broader plan to forget Borzov, forget any expert, forget all
witnesses as a whole, and simply not show up for the trial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After a few more
questions, Wally said, ¡°We tender Dr. Igor Borzov as an expert witness in the
field of cardiology.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright
looked at the defense table and said, ¡°Ms. Karros?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She stood and with
a wicked smile replied, ¡°We have no objections.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In other words,
we¡¯ll help feed him all the rope he needs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally asked Dr.
Borzov if he had reviewed the medical records of Percy Klopeck. He replied with
a clear yes. For half an hour, they discussed Percy¡¯s dismal medical history,
then began the tedious process of admitting the records into evidence. It would
have taken hours if not for the remarkable cooperation of the defense. Ms.
Karros could have objected to a lot of the material, but she wanted everything
laid out for the jurors. By the time the four-inch-thick file was admitted,
several of them were struggling to stay awake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The testimony
improved dramatically with the aid of a greatly enlarged diagram of a human
heart. It was presented on a large screen, and Dr. Borzov was given wide
latitude in describing it for the jury. Walking back and forth in front of the
screen, and with the aid of a pointing stick, he did a decent job of describing
the valves, chambers, <a name=page297></a>and arteries. When he said something
that no one understood, Wally helpfully repeated it for the benefit of the
others. Wally knew this would be the easy portion of his testimony, and he took
his time. The good doctor seemed to know his stuff, but then any second-year
med student was well versed in this material. When the tutorial was finally
finished, Borzov returned to the witness stand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Two months before
he died in his sleep, Percy had undergone his annual physical, complete with
EKG and echocardiogram, thus providing Dr. Borzov with something to talk about.
Wally handed him the echo report, and the two spent fifteen minutes discussing
the basics of an echocardiogram. Percy¡¯s showed a marked decrease in the
regurgitation of blood from the left ventricle chamber.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David took a deep
breath as lawyer and witness waded into the minefield of technical, medical
jargon. It was a disaster from the very beginning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Krayoxx supposedly
damaged the mitral valve in such a way that it impeded the flow of blood as it
was being pumped out of the heart. In an attempt to explain this, Borzov used
the term ¡°left ventricle ejection fraction.¡± When asked to clarify this for the
jury, Borzov said: ¡°The ejection fraction is actually the ventricular volume at
end-diastole minus end-systole, the ventricle volume, and that divided by the
total volume times one hundred is the ejection fraction.¡± Such language was
incomprehensible to laymen when delivered in slow, precise English. Out of Dr.
Borzov¡¯s mouth, it was nothing but gibberish and sadly comical.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine Karros rose
and said, ¡°Your Honor, please.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright
shook his head as if he¡¯d been slapped and said, ¡°Come on, Mr. Figg.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Three of the jurors
were glaring at David as if he had insulted them. A couple were suppressing
chuckles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Treading water,
Wally asked his witness to speak slowly, clearly, and, if possible, in easier
language. They plodded along, Borzov trying his best, Wally repeating virtually
everything he said until some clarity <a name=page298></a>was achieved, but not
much and not nearly enough. Borzov discussed the grading of mitral
insufficiency, the regurgitation of the left atrial area, and the level of
severity of the mitral regurgitation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Long after the jury
gave up, Wally asked a series of questions about the interpretation of the
echocardiogram, and it prompted this response: ¡°If the ventricle was totally
symmetrical and had no discrepancies in the wall motion or geometry, it would
be a prolate ellipsoid. Just defines flat end and pointed end and gentle curve,
an ellipsoid fraction. So the ventricle would contract down, would still be a
prolate ellipsoid, but all walls would move except the plane of mitral valve.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The court reporter
raised her hand and blurted, ¡°I¡¯m sorry, Your Honor, but I¡¯m not getting this.¡±
Judge Seawright¡¯s eyes closed, his head was down, as if he, too, had given up
and just wanted Borzov to finish and get out of the courtroom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Fifteen-minute
recess,¡± he mumbled.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally
and David sat silent before two untouched cups of coffee in the small caf&eacute;. It
was 4:30 Monday afternoon, and both felt as though they¡¯d spent a month in
Seawright¡¯s courtroom. Neither wanted to see it again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>While David was
stunned by Borzov¡¯s thoroughly discreditable performance, he was also thinking
about Wally¡¯s drinking. He wasn¡¯t drunk and didn¡¯t appear under the influence,
but any return to the bottle for an alcoholic was troubling. He wanted to quiz
him, to see if he was okay, but the place and time seemed inappropriate. Why
bring up such a dreadful subject under such miserable circumstances?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally stared at a
spot on the floor, motionless, off in another world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t think the
jury is with us,¡± David said offhandedly, no effort at humor. But Wally smiled
and said, ¡°The jury hates us and I don¡¯t blame them. We won¡¯t make it past
summary judgment. As soon as we finish our case, Seawright will throw us out of
court.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So a quick end?
Can¡¯t blame him for that.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A quick and
merciful end,¡± Wally said, still staring at the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page299></a><span
lang=EN>¡°What will it mean for the other issues, like sanctions and
malpractice?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who knows? I think
the malpractice cases will go away. You can¡¯t get sued just because you lose a
case at trial. Sanctions, though, could be another story. I can see Varrick
going for our jugulars, claiming the case had no merit.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David finally took
a sip of coffee. Wally said, ¡°I keep thinking about Jerry Alisandros. I¡¯d like
to catch him in an alley and beat him senseless with a baseball bat.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Now that¡¯s a
pleasant thought.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯d better go.
Let¡¯s finish with Borzov and get him out of here.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For
the next hour, the courtroom suffered through the tortuous process of watching
the video of Percy¡¯s echocardiogram while Dr. Borzov attempted to describe what
they were seeing. With the lights dimmed, several of the jurors began to nod
off. When the video ended, Borzov returned to the witness chair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How much longer,
Mr. Figg?¡± the judge asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Five minutes.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Proceed.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Even the flimsiest
of cases require certain magical language. Wally wanted to slip it in quickly
while the jury was comatose and, just maybe, the defense was ready to go home.
¡°Now, Dr. Borzov, do you have an opinion, based on a reasonable degree of
medical certainty, as to the cause of the death of Mr. Percy Klopeck?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I do.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David was watching
Nadine Karros, who with little effort could have excluded any and all expert
opinions from Borzov on numerous grounds. She seemed to have no interest in
doing so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And what is that
opinion?¡± Wally asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°My opinion, based
on a reasonable degree of medical certainty, is that Mr. Klopeck died of acute
myocardial infarction, or heart attack.¡± Borzov offered this opinion slowly,
his English much clearer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page300></a><span
lang=EN>¡°And do you have an opinion as to the cause of his heart attack?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°My opinion, based
on a reasonable degree of medical certainty, is that the heart attack was
caused by an enlarged left ventricle chamber.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And do you have an
opinion as to what caused the enlargement of the left ventricle chamber?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°My opinion, based
on a reasonable degree of medical certainty, is that the enlargement was caused
by the ingestion of the cholesterol drug Krayoxx.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At least four of
the jurors were shaking their heads. Two others looked as though they wanted to
stand and yell obscenities at Borzov.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At 6:00 p.m., the
witness was finally excused and the jury sent home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Adjourned until
nine o¡¯clock in the morning,¡± Judge Seawright said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Riding back to the
office, Wally fell asleep in the passenger¡¯s seat. Stuck in traffic, David
checked his cell phone, then went online to check the market. Varrick¡¯s stock
had jumped from $31.50 to $35.00.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>News of the
company¡¯s imminent victory was spreading fast.</span></p>

<p class=0Block style='page-break-before:always'><a name="Top_of_part0042_html"></a><a

CHAPTER_40'><span lang=EN>CHAPTER 40</span></span></h1>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>During her first two months on earth, little Emma
had yet to sleep through the night. Down by eight, she was usually up by eleven
for a quick snack and a clean diaper. A lengthy session of floor walking and
chair rocking knocked her out by midnight, but by 3:00 a.m. she was hungry
again. At first, Helen gamely clung to the plan of breastfeeding, but after six
weeks she was exhausted and introduced the bottle. Emma¡¯s father was not
sleeping much either, and they usually had a quiet chat during the predawn
meals while Momma stayed under the covers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Tuesday, around
4:30 a.m., David gently placed her back in the crib, turned off the light, and
eased from the room. He went to the kitchen, made coffee, and as it brewed, he
went online to check the news, weather, and law blogs. One blog in particular
had followed the Krayoxx litigation and the Klopeck trial, and David was
tempted to ignore it. But he could not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The headline read:
¡°Mauling in Courtroom 2314.¡± The blogger, known as the Hung Juror, obviously
had too much time on his hands, or perhaps he was one of the Rogan Rothberg
grunts. He wrote: ¡°For those with a morbid sense of curiosity, hustle on over
to Courtroom 2314 in the Dirksen Federal Building today for round two of the
world¡¯s first, and probably only, Krayoxx trial. For those of you who cannot
attend, it¡¯s like watching a train wreck in slow motion, and a helluva lot <a
name=page302></a>of fun to boot. Yesterday, opening day, the jurors and
spectators were treated to the gruesome sight of the widow Iris Klopeck
testifying by video. Supposedly, she cannot attend the trial for medical
reasons, though one of my spies saw her shopping for groceries yesterday at the
Dominick¡¯s on Pulaski Road (click here for photos). This gal is one heavy
woman, and when her face hit the screen yesterday, it was quite a shock. At
first she seemed, well, rather stoned, but as the deposition wore on the drugs
seemed to wear off. She even managed a few tears when talking about her beloved
Percy, who died at forty-eight years and 320 pounds. Iris wants the jury to
give her a truckload of cash and she tried her best to evoke sympathy. Didn¡¯t
work. Most of the jurors were thinking the same thing I was thinking&#8212;if you
people weren¡¯t so big, you wouldn¡¯t have so many health problems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Her dream team,
now minus its leader, who had a heart attack of his own last week when he came
face-to-face with a real jury, has made only one brilliant move so far, and that
was to keep Iris out of the courtroom and away from the jury. No more
brilliance is expected from these two lightweights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Their second
witness was their star expert, a certified quack from Russia who has, so far,
after fifteen years in this country, failed to master the most rudimentary
elements of the English language. His name is Igor, and when Igor speaks, no
one listens. Igor could easily have been bounced by the defense on the grounds
that he is unqualified&#8212;his deficiencies are too numerous to mention&#8212;but it
seems as though the defense has adopted a strategy of allowing the plaintiff¡¯s
lawyers all the room they need to prove they have no case whatsoever. The
defense wants Igor on the stand&#8212;he helps their side!¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Enough! David
closed his laptop and went for the coffee. He showered and dressed quietly,
kissed Helen good-bye, peeked in on Emma, then headed out. When he turned onto
Preston, he noticed the lights were on at Finley &amp; Figg. It was 5:45, and
Wally was hard at work. Good, thought David, maybe the junior partner had
discovered some new theory they could spring on Nadine Karros and Harry
Seawright and reduce some of the humiliation. But Wally¡¯s car was not parked <a
name=page303></a>behind the building. The rear door was unlocked, as was the
front. AC was prowling around the first floor, agitated. Wally was not in his
office; he was not to be found. David locked the doors and went to his office
upstairs, followed by AC. There were no messages on his desk, no e-mails. He
called Wally¡¯s cell and got voice mail. Strange, but then Wally¡¯s routine often
varied. However, neither he nor Oscar had ever left the office unlocked and the
lights on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David tried to
review some materials but couldn¡¯t concentrate. His nerves were edgy because of
the trial, and now there was a nagging sense that something else was wrong. He
walked downstairs and had a quick look around Wally¡¯s office. The wastebasket
next to his credenza was empty. David hated to do it, but he pulled open a few
drawers and found nothing of interest. In the kitchen, next to the narrow
fridge, there was a tall round wastebasket where the coffee grounds were dumped
along with food containers and empty bottles and cans. David removed the white
plastic liner, opened it wide, and found what he was afraid he might find. To one
side, lying on top of a yogurt container, was an empty pint bottle of Smirnoff
vodka. David removed it, rinsed it in the sink while he washed his hands, and
took it upstairs, where he sat it on his desk and stared at it for a long time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally had a few
beers during lunch, then spent part of the night at the office, drinking vodka,
and at some point decided to leave. Evidently he was drunk, because he left the
lights on and the doors unlocked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They had agreed to
meet at 7:00 a.m. for coffee and a work session. By 7:15, David was worried. He
called Rochelle and asked if she had heard from Wally. ¡°No, is something
wrong?¡± she asked, as if a bad phone call about Wally was never unexpected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, just looking
for him, that¡¯s all. You¡¯ll be in at eight, right?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m leaving the
apartment now. I¡¯ll run by and check on Oscar, then come to the office.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David wanted to
call Oscar but could not bring himself to do so. His triple bypass had been six
days earlier, and David was not about to upset him. He paced the floor, fed AC,
and tried Wally¡¯s cell again. <a name=page304></a>Nothing. Rochelle arrived
promptly at eight with the news that Oscar was doing okay and had not seen
Wally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He didn¡¯t come
home last night,¡± she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David pulled the
empty pint bottle out of his back pants pocket and said, ¡°I found this in the
kitchen wastebasket. Wally got drunk last night, here, and left the doors
unlocked and the lights on when he left.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle stared at
the bottle and wanted to cry. She had nursed Wally through his previous battles
and she had cheered him on through his rehabs. She had held his hand, prayed
for him, cried for him, and celebrated with him as he joyfully counted the days
of sobriety. One year, two weeks, and two days, and now they were looking at an
empty bottle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I guess the pressure
got to him,¡± David said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°When he falls, he
falls hard, David, and each one is worse than the last.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David set the
bottle on the table. ¡°But he was so proud of being sober,¡± he said. ¡°I can¡¯t
believe this.¡± What he really couldn¡¯t believe was that the dream team (or the
three stooges) was down to its last man standing. And though his partners were
woefully lacking in trial experience, they were seasoned veterans compared with
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You think he¡¯ll
show up in court?¡± David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>No, she did not,
but Rochelle didn¡¯t have the heart to be blunt. ¡°Probably so. You need to get
on the road.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It
was a long drive downtown. David called Helen and broke the news. She was as
bewildered as her husband and offered the opinion that the judge would have no choice
but to postpone the proceedings. David liked the sound of that, and by the time
he parked, he was convinced that if Wally didn¡¯t show, he could prevail upon
Judge Seawright to grant a continuance. In all fairness, losing the two lead
lawyers in a case was surely grounds for either a mistrial or a postponement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally was not in
the courtroom. David sat alone at counsel table as <a name=page305></a>the
Rogan Rothberg team filed in and the spectators took their seats. At 8:50,
David eased over to a bailiff and said he needed to see Judge Seawright, and it
was urgent. ¡°Follow me,¡± the bailiff said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright had
just put on his black robe when David entered his chambers. Skipping the
greetings, David said, ¡°Judge, we have a problem. Mr. Figg is AWOL. He¡¯s not
here and I don¡¯t think he¡¯ll show up.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The judge exhaled
in frustration and continued to slowly zip up his robe. ¡°You don¡¯t know where
he is?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No sir.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright
looked at the bailiff and said, ¡°Go fetch Ms. Karros.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When Nadine
arrived, alone, she and David sat with the judge at the end of his long
conference table. David told them all that he knew and pulled no punches about
Wally¡¯s history with alcohol. They were sympathetic and uncertain about what
this meant for the trial. David confessed that he felt thoroughly unprepared
and inadequate to handle whatever was left to be done, but at the same time he
could not imagine the firm attempting to try the case again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Let¡¯s face it,¡± he
said, holding nothing back, ¡°we don¡¯t have much of a case and we knew that when
we started. We¡¯ve pushed this thing about as far as we can, and we¡¯ve done so
only to avoid sanctions and malpractice suits.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You want a
continuance?¡± the judge asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes. I think it¡¯s
only fair under the circumstances.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine said, ¡°My

hard to finish this trial.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright
said, ¡°I¡¯m not sure a continuance will work. If Mr. Figg is back on the booze,
and drinking so much he fails to show up for court, it might take some time to
get him detoxed again and ready for action. I am not inclined to consider a
continuance.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David could not
argue with this logic. ¡°Judge, I have no idea what to do out there. I¡¯ve never

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There was a long
pause as the three contemplated their rather unique dilemma. Finally, Nadine
said, ¡°I have a deal. If you will finish the trial, I will convince my client

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright
chimed in quickly, ¡°Mr. Zinc, if you will finish the trial, I guarantee there

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Great, but what
about the malpractice claims?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine said
nothing, but the judge replied, ¡°I doubt you¡¯ll be in trouble there. I¡¯m not
aware of a successful malpractice action against a lawyer who simply lost a
trial.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Nor am I,¡± Nadine
added. ¡°There¡¯s a winner and a loser in every trial.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Of course, David
thought, and it must be nice to win every time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Let¡¯s do this,¡±
the judge said. ¡°We¡¯ll stand in recess today&#8212;I¡¯ll send the jury home&#8212;and you do
your best to find Mr. Figg. If by chance he shows up tomorrow, we¡¯ll continue
as if nothing happened, and I will not punish him for today. If you don¡¯t find
him, or if he¡¯s unable to continue, then we¡¯ll resume the proceedings at nine
in the morning. You do your best, and I¡¯ll help you as much as I possibly can.
We¡¯ll finish the trial, and that will be the end of it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What about an
appeal?¡± Nadine asked. ¡°Losing the two lead lawyers might make a convincing
argument for a new trial.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David managed a
smile and said, ¡°I promise you there will be no appeal, not that I¡¯m involved
in. This case could very well bankrupt our little firm. We borrowed money to
litigate this far. I can¡¯t imagine my partners wasting another moment fooling
with an appeal. If they were to somehow win one, then they would be forced to
come back here and try the case again. That¡¯s the last thing they want.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°All right, so we
have a deal?¡± the judge asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°As far as I¡¯m

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page307></a><span

the threat of sanctions, and probably malpractice as well. His only other

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure, it¡¯s a

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He
took his time driving back to the office. He continually reminded himself that

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>The Hung Juror blogged on: ¡°A brief day in the
Klopeck-Krayoxx trial as the dream team had trouble getting itself together.
Word on the street is that the lead lawyer, the Honorable Wallis T. Figg,
failed to answer the bell, and his rookie sidekick was sent to look for him. Figg
wasn¡¯t seen in the courtroom just before 9:00 a.m. Judge Seawright sent the
jury home with instructions to return this morning. Repeated calls to the
Finley &amp; Figg office went straight to voice mail; none returned by the
staff, if the firm does indeed have a staff. Wonder if Figg is on a bender?
Fair question in light of the fact that he¡¯s had at least two DUIs in the past
twelve years, the last one a year ago. My records show that Figg has been
married and divorced four times. I tracked down wife number 2, and she recalled
that Wally¡¯s always battled the bottle. When contacted at her home yesterday,
the plaintiff, Iris Klopeck, who is still allegedly too sick to come to court,
replied, ¡®I¡¯m not surprised,¡¯ when told that her lawyer had failed to show. Then
she hung up. Noted legal malpractice lawyer Bart Shaw has been seen sneaking
around the courtroom&#8212;rumor is that Shaw might pick up the pieces of the Krayoxx
mess and go after Finley &amp; Figg for botching the cases. So far, the Klopeck
case has not been botched, in theory. The jury has not decided. Stay tuned.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David scanned other
blogs as he ate a granola bar at his desk and waited for Wally, though he
really didn¡¯t expect him. No one had <a name=page310></a>heard a word&#8212;Oscar,
Rochelle, DeeAnna, a couple of lawyer buddies from his former poker club. Oscar
had called a pal at the police station for an informal inquiry, though neither
he nor David suspected foul play. According to Rochelle, Wally once disappeared
for a week without a peep, then called Oscar from a motel in Green Bay,
pickled. David was getting a lot of Wally the Drunk stories, and he found them
odd because he had known only the sober Wally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle arrived
early and climbed the stairs, something she rarely did. She was concerned about
David and offered to help in any way. He thanked her and began packing files in
his briefcase. She fed AC, got her yogurt, and was arranging her desk when she
looked at her e-mails. ¡°David!¡± she yelled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was from Wally,
dated October 26, 5:10 a.m., sent from his iPhone: ¡°RG: Hey, I¡¯m alive. Don¡¯t
call the police and don¡¯t pay the ransom. WF.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thank heavens,¡±
Rochelle said. ¡°He¡¯s okay.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He doesn¡¯t say
he¡¯s okay. He just says he¡¯s alive. I suppose that¡¯s a good thing.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What does he mean
by ¡®ransom¡¯?¡± she wondered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Probably his
effort to be funny. Ha-ha.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David called
Wally¡¯s cell phone three times as he drove downtown. His voice mail was full.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In a
room filled with somber men in dark suits, a beautiful woman attracts far more
attention than she would by simply walking down a busy street. Nadine Karros
had used her looks like a weapon as she had risen to the top of the elite
courtroom advocates in the Chicago area. On Wednesday, she had some
competition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Finley &amp; Figg¡¯s
new paralegal arrived at 8:45 and, as planned, went straight to Ms. Karros and
introduced herself as Helen Hancock (maiden name), one of the part-time
paralegals at Finley &amp; Figg. Then she introduced herself to several of the
other defense lawyers, causing all of them to stop whatever they were working
on, stand awkwardly, <a name=page311></a>shake hands, smile, and be nice. At
five feet eight inches and wearing four-inch heels, Helen was a few inches
taller than Nadine, and she looked down on some of the others as well. With her
hazel eyes and chic designer frames, not to mention the slender figure and
skirt six inches above the knees, Helen succeeded in slightly disrupting the
pregame rituals, if only for a moment. The spectators, almost all men, looked
her over. Her husband, who was ignoring all of this, pointed to a chair behind
his and said in a lawyerly fashion, ¡°Get me those files.¡± Then, in a lower
voice, he said, ¡°You look spectacular, but don¡¯t smile at me.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, boss,¡± she
said, unfastening a briefcase, one of several in his collection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thanks for
coming.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>An hour earlier,
from his desk, David had e-mailed Judge Seawright and Nadine Karros with the
news that Mr. Figg had been heard from but would not be in court. They did not
know where he was or when they might actually see him. For all David knew,
Wally could be back in Green Bay, in a motel, comatose and pickled, though he
kept this to himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Dr. Igor Borzov was
reintroduced to the proceedings and took the stand with the look of a leper
about to be stoned. Judge Seawright said, ¡°You may cross-examine, Ms. Karros.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She walked to the
podium in another killer outfit&#8212;a lavender knit dress that fit snug and did an
outstanding job of showcasing her shapely and quite firm backside, and a thick
brown leather belt that was pulled tight to announce ¡°Yes, I¡¯m in a size 4.¡±
She began by offering the expert a lovely smile and asking him to speak slowly
because she had trouble understanding on Monday. Borzov mumbled incoherently in
return.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With so many
obvious targets, it was impossible to predict where she might attack first.
David had been unable to prepare Borzov, not that he wanted to spend another
minute with the man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Dr. Borzov, when
was the last time you treated a patient of your own?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page312></a><span
lang=EN>He had to think for a moment and eventually said, ¡°About ten year.¡±
This led to a series of questions about what, exactly, he had been doing for
the past ten years. He had not been seeing patients, nor teaching, nor
researching, nor doing all the things one would expect a doctor to do. Finally,
when she had excluded virtually everything, she asked: ¡°Isn¡¯t it true, Dr.
Borzov, that for the past ten years you have worked exclusively for various
trial lawyers?¡± Borzov squirmed a bit. He wasn¡¯t so sure about that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine was. She had
the facts, all gleaned from a deposition given by Borzov in another case one
year earlier. Armed with the details, she took him by the hand and led him down
the path of destruction. Year by year, she went through the lawsuits, the
screenings, the drugs, and the lawyers, and when she finished an hour later, it
was clear to everyone in the courtroom that Igor Borzov was nothing but a
rubber-stamper for the mass tort bar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On her legal pad,
the paralegal slipped David a note: ¡°Where did you find this guy?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David wrote back:
¡°Impressive, huh? And his fee is only $75,000.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Paid by whom?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You don¡¯t want to
know.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Evidently, the hot
seat affected his diction, or perhaps Borzov did not wish to be understood. At
any rate, he became increasingly more difficult to understand. Nadine kept her
cool, so much so that David seriously doubted if she ever lost it. He was
watching a master, and he was taking notes, not to help resuscitate his
witness, but on effective cross-examination techniques.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The jurors could
not have cared less. They were gone, checked out, already waiting for the next
witness. Nadine sensed this and began culling her list of problem areas. At
11:00 a.m., Judge Seawright needed a potty break and called a twenty-minute
recess. When the jury left the courtroom, Borzov approached David and asked,
¡°How much longer?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I have no idea,¡±
David replied. The doctor was sweating and <a name=page313></a>breathing heavy;
his armpits were wet. Too bad, David wanted to say. At least you¡¯re getting
paid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>During the recess,
Nadine Karros and her team made the tactical decision to stay away from a
replaying of Percy¡¯s echocardiogram. With Borzov bloodied and on the ropes, the
echo might allow him to regain some footing since he could once again lose the
jury with medical jargon. After the recess, when Borzov slowly returned to the
witness chair, she began chipping away at his education, with a heavy emphasis
on the differences between med school here and med school in Russia. She went
through a list of courses and lectures, standard here but unheard-of ¡°over
there.¡± She knew the answer to every question she asked, and Borzov, by now,
knew this. He became increasingly more hesitant to give a response directly,
knowing that any discrepancy, however slight, would be pounced upon, dissected,
and slung back at him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She hammered away
at his training and managed to trip him a few times. By noon, the jurors, those
still watching the mayhem, had the clear impression of a doctor they wouldn¡¯t
trust to prescribe lip balm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Why had he never
written any papers? He claimed there had been some in Russia but was forced to
admit they had not been translated. Why had he never taught or joined a
faculty? The classroom bored him, he tried to explain, though it was painful to
imagine Borzov attempting to communicate with a group of students.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>During lunch, David
and his paralegal hustled out of the building and went to a deli around the
corner. Helen was fascinated by the proceedings but still stunned by Dr.
Borzov¡¯s pathetic showing. ¡°Just for the record,¡± she said over a spring salad,
¡°if we ever reach the point of a divorce, I¡¯m hiring Nadine.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oh, really. Well,
then, I¡¯ll be forced to hire Wally Figg, if I can keep him sober.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re toast.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Forget the
divorce, baby, you¡¯re too cute and you have great potential as a courtroom
paralegal.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page314></a><span
lang=EN>Helen grew serious and said, ¡°Look, I realize you have a lot on your
mind right now, but you must be thinking about the future. You can¡¯t stay at
Finley &amp; Figg. What if Oscar can¡¯t come back? What if Wally can¡¯t kick the
booze? And assuming they can, why would you want to stay there?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t know. I
haven¡¯t had much time to think about it.¡± He had shielded her from the twin
nightmares of the Rule 11 sanctions and the potential malpractice cases, and he
had decided not to tell her about the $200,000 line of credit he had guaranteed
along with the two partners. Leaving the firm in the near future was not
likely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Let¡¯s talk about
it later,¡± he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m sorry. It¡¯s
just that I think you can do so much better, that¡¯s all.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thank you, dear.
What&#8212;you¡¯re not impressed with my courtroom skills?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re brilliant,
but I suspect one big trial might be enough for you.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°By the way, Nadine
Karros doesn¡¯t do divorces.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Then that settles
it. I guess I¡¯ll just tough it out.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At
1:30, Borzov tottered to the witness stand for the last time, and Nadine began
her final assault. Since he was a cardiologist who didn¡¯t treat patients, it
was safe to assume he never treated Percy Klopeck. True, plus Mr. Klopeck had
been dead a long time before Borzov was hired as an expert. But surely he had
consulted the doctors who did treat him. No, Borzov admitted, he had not.
Feigning disbelief, she began hammering away at this incredible oversight. His
responses grew slower, his voice weaker, his Russian thicker, until finally, at
2:45, Borzov pulled a white handkerchief from a coat pocket and began waving
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Such drama was not
contemplated by the wise folks who wrote the rules of federal trial procedure,
and David was uncertain about what <a name=page315></a>he should do. He stood
and said, ¡°Your Honor, I think this witness has had enough.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Dr. Borzov, are
you okay?¡± Judge Seawright asked. The answer was obvious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The witness shook
his head no.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Nothing further,
Your Honor,¡± Ms. Karros announced and left the podium, another impressive
annihilation under her belt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Any redirect, Mr.
Zinc?¡± the Judge asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The last thing
David wanted to do was to try to revive a dead witness. ¡°No sir,¡± he said
quickly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Dr. Borzov, you¡¯re
excused.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He staggered away
with the aid of a bailiff, $75,000 richer but with another black mark on his
r&eacute;sum&eacute;. Judge Seawright recessed court until 3:30.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Dr.
Herbert Threadgill was a pharmacologist of dubious reputation. He, like Borzov,
was spending the waning days of his career living the easy life, away from the
rigors of real medicine, doing nothing but testifying for lawyers who needed
his notoriously pliant opinions to fit their version of the facts. The paths of
both professional testifiers crossed occasionally, and they knew each other
well. Threadgill had been reluctant to sign on for the Klopeck case for three
reasons: the facts were lousy; the case was weak; and he had no desire to face
Nadine Karros in a courtroom. He had finally said yes for only one
reason&#8212;$50,000 plus expenses, for only a few hours of work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>During the recess,
he saw Dr. Borzov outside the courtroom and was appalled at his appearance.
¡°Don¡¯t do it,¡± Borzov said as he shuffled toward the elevators. Threadgill
hurried to the men¡¯s room, splashed some water in his face, and decided to
flee. Screw the case. Screw the lawyers, they were not major players anyway. He
had been paid in full, and if they threatened to sue, he might consider
returning a portion of his fee, or not. He would be on an airplane in an hour.
In three hours <a name=page316></a>he would be having a drink with his wife on
the patio. He wasn¡¯t committing a crime. He was under no subpoena. If
necessary, he would never return to Chicago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At 4:00 p.m., David
returned to the judge¡¯s chambers and said, ¡°Well, Judge, looks like we¡¯ve lost
another one. I can¡¯t find Dr. Threadgill, and he won¡¯t answer his phone.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°When did you last
speak to him?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°During lunch. He

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Do you have

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes sir, my

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Then put her on,
and we¡¯ll see if the lost sheep somehow find their way home.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Percy Klopeck
worked for twenty-two years as a dispatcher for a freight company. It was a
sedentary job, and Percy did nothing to break the monotony of sitting in a
chair for eight straight hours. Non-union, he was earning $44,000 a year when
he died and could have reasonably expected to work for seventeen more years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Dr. Kanya Meade was
a young economist at the University of Chicago, and she moonlighted
occasionally as a consultant to pick up a few bucks&#8212;$15,000 in the Klopeck
case. The math was straightforward: $44,000 a year for seventeen years, plus
anticipated annual increases based on the historical trend, plus a retirement
based on a fifteen-year life expectancy beyond the age of sixty-five, at 70
percent of his highest salary. In summary, Dr. Meade testified that Percy¡¯s
death had cost his family $1.51 million.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Since he had died
peacefully in his sleep, there would be no claim for pain and suffering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On
cross-examination, Ms. Karros took exception to the numbers of Percy¡¯s life
expectancy. Since he had died at forty-eight, and early deaths were common
among his male blood relatives, it was unrealistic to suggest that he would
have lived to age eighty. Nadine was careful, though, not to spend much time
debating damages. To do so <a name=page317></a>would lend credence to the
numbers. The Klopecks were not due a penny, and she would not give the
impression she was worried about the alleged damages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When Dr. Meade
finished at 5:20, Judge Seawright adjourned court until nine the following morning.</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>After a hard day in court, Helen was in no mood
to cook. She picked up Emma at her sister¡¯s home in Evanston, thanked her
sister profusely and promised to debrief later, and raced away to the nearest
fast-food restaurant. Emma, who slept in moving vehicles much better than in
her own crib, dozed peacefully as Helen inched along in the drive-thru. She
ordered more burgers and fries than usual because she and David were both
hungry. It was raining, and the late-October days were growing shorter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Helen drove to the
Khaings¡¯ apartment near Rogers Park, and by the time she arrived, David was
there. The plan was to have a quick dinner and hustle home for an early
bedtime&#8212;Emma, of course, holding the key to that. David had no more witnesses to
present for the plaintiff, and he was not sure what to expect from Nadine
Karros. In the pretrial order, the defense had listed twenty-seven expert
witnesses, and David had read every one of their reports. Only Nadine Karros
knew how many to call to the stand, and in what order. There was little for
David to do but sit, listen, object occasionally, pass notes to his comely
paralegal, and try to give the impression he knew what was going on. According
to a friend from law school, a litigator in a Washington firm, there was an
excellent chance the defense would move for summary judgment, convince
Seawright that the plaintiff had failed to provide even the bare bones of a
proper case, and win outright without presenting a single witness. ¡°It could be
over tomorrow,¡± <a name=page319></a>he said as he sat in traffic in Washington
and David did the same in Chicago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Since Thuya had
been released from the hospital five months earlier, the Zincs had missed only
a few of their Wednesday night fast-food dinners. The arrival of Emma had briefly
interrupted things, but before long they were packing her along for the visits.
A ritual had clearly been established. As Helen approached the apartment
building with the baby, Lwin and Zaw, mother and grandmother, bolted from the
door and raced to see the baby. Inside, Lynn and Erin, Thuya¡¯s two older
sisters, sat side by side on the sofa, waiting eagerly to get their hands on
Emma. Helen would place her gently in one of the laps, and the girls and their
mother and grandmother would chatter and squeal and act as if they had never
before seen an infant. They gently passed her around, back and forth with great
care. This would go on for a long time while the men were starving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Thuya watched it
from his high chair and seemed amused. Each week David and Helen hoped to see
some tiny sign of improvement in his condition, and each week they were
disappointed. As his doctors predicted, progress was highly unlikely. The
damage was, after all, permanent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David sat by him,
rubbed his head as always, and handed him a French fry. He chatted with Soe and
Lu as the women formed a gaggle around the baby. Eventually, they made their
way to the table, where they were delighted to learn that David and Helen would
be eating with them. They usually avoided burgers and fries, but not tonight.
David explained that they were a bit rushed and would not have time to take
Thuya out for a drive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Halfway through a
cheeseburger, David¡¯s cell phone vibrated in his coat pocket. He looked at it,
jumped to his feet, whispered ¡°It¡¯s Wally¡± to Helen, and stepped outside the
front door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Where are you,
Wally?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In a weak, dying
voice, the reply came, ¡°I¡¯m drunk, David. So drunk.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s what we
figured. Where are you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page320></a><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure, Wally, you
know I¡¯ll help, but where are you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°At the office.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll be there in
forty-five minutes.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He
was on the sofa next to the table, snoring, AC nearby watching him with great
suspicion. It was Wednesday night, and David assumed, correctly, that Wally¡¯s
last shower had been bright and early Monday morning, the day the retrial
commenced, six days after Oscar¡¯s dramatic collapse, and six days after Wally¡¯s
legendary mistrial. No shower, no shave, no change of clothes&#8212;he was wearing
the same navy suit and white shirt as when David had last seen him. The tie was
missing. The shirt was heavily stained. There was a slight tear on the right
leg of his trousers. Dried mud caked the soles of his new black wing tips.
David tapped his shoulder and called his name. Nothing. His face was red and
puffy, but there were no bruises, cuts, or scrapes. Perhaps he had not been
brawling in bars. David wanted to know where he had been, but then he didn¡¯t.
Wally was safe. There would be time for questions later, one being ¡°How¡¯d you
get here?¡± His car was nowhere in sight, which was somewhat of a relief. Maybe,
drunk as he was, Wally had the presence of mind not to drive. On the other
hand, his car could have been wrecked, stolen, or repossessed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David punched him on
the biceps and yelled from six inches away. Wally¡¯s heavy breathing paused for
a second, then continued. AC was whining, so David let him out for a pee and
made a pot of coffee. He sent a text to Helen: ¡°Drunk as a skunk but alive. Not
sure what¡¯s next.¡± He called Rochelle and passed along the news. A call to
Oscar¡¯s cell went straight to voice mail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally rallied an
hour later and took a cup of coffee. ¡°Thanks, David,¡± he said over and over.
Then, ¡°Have you called Lisa?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And who might Lisa
be?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page321></a><span

talk to me.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David decided to
play along, to see where the chatter might go. ¡°I did call Lisa.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You did? What did
she say?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Said you guys got
a divorce years ago.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That sounds just

eye contact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She said she still
loves you, though,¡± David said, just for the fun of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally started
crying, the way drunks do when they cry over nothing and everything. David felt
a little lousy but a lot more amused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m sorry,¡± Wally
said, wiping his face with a forearm. ¡°I¡¯m so sorry, David, thank you. Oscar
won¡¯t talk to me, you know. Laid up in my apartment, hiding from his wife,
cleaning out my refrigerator. I came home, had the door locked and chained. We
had a big fight, neighbors called the police, I barely got away. Running away
from my own apartment now, what kinda deal is that?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°When did this
happen?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t know. An

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re welcome.
Look, Wally, we need to put together a plan. Sounds like your apartment is
off-limits. If you want to sleep here tonight and sober up, I¡¯ll pull up a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I need help,

sober will be an important first step.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally suddenly
burst into laughter. He threw his head back and laughed as loud as humanly
possible. He shook, squealed, gyrated, coughed, lost his breath, wiped his
cheeks, and when he couldn¡¯t laugh anymore, he sat and chuckled for several
minutes. When things were under control, he glanced at David and laughed again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Got something

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page322></a><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Falling-down

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I looked at Oscar,

away for a moment. ¡°You threw up twice. Now who¡¯s drunk and who¡¯s sober?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We¡¯re gonna get
you sober, Wally.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>His body was no

got yourself into here, David? You had it all, big firm, big salary, life in
the lawyers¡¯ fast lane.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I have no regrets,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Another long pause
and Wally cradled his coffee cup with both hands and stared into it. ¡°What¡¯s

lawyer who thought he could play in the big leagues.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Now is not the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page323></a><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Where was the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°My counselor,¡±

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David left a

¡°Don¡¯t let him out of your sight,¡± Patrick said. ¡°Please, bring him in now.
I¡¯ll meet you at the House in an hour.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Let¡¯s go, big
boy,¡± David said, grabbing Wally by the arm. He stood, found his balance, and
they walked arm in arm out of the building to David¡¯s SUV. By the time they
accelerated onto I-94 North, Wally was snoring again.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With
the help of his GPS, David found Harbor House an hour after they left the
office. It was a small, private treatment facility, tucked away in the woods
just north of Waukegan, Illinois. David was unable to rouse Wally, so he left
him and went inside, where Patrick Hale was waiting in the reception room.
Patrick sent two white-robed orderlies with a stretcher out to fetch Wally, and
five minutes later they <a name=page324></a>wheeled him in, still unconscious.
David followed Patrick to a small office where paperwork was waiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How many times has

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Patrick was looking

Because of our exceptional treatment, and results, and facilities and staff, we
charge $1,500 a day. Wally left here owing slightly less than $14,000. He¡¯s

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Reuben Massey arrived after dark on a Varrick
Gulfstream G650. He landed at Midway Airport and was immediately scooped up by
an entourage that sped away in black Cadillac Escalades. Thirty minutes later
he entered the Trust Tower and was whisked high into the sky to the 101st
floor, where Rogan Rothberg kept an elegant private dining room that was used
by only the most senior partners and their most important clients. Nicholas
Walker and Judy Beck were waiting, along with Nadine Karros and Marvin Macklow,
the managing partner of the law firm. A waiter wearing a white tux brought
cocktails as everyone was properly introduced and became comfortable with each
other. Reuben had been wanting to meet, and examine, Nadine Karros for many
months. He was not disappointed. She turned on the charm, and after the first
cocktail Reuben was thoroughly smitten. He ran the ladies hard and was always
on the prowl, and, well, you never know what might happen with a new
acquaintance. However, according to the scouting report, she was happily
married, and her only diversion was working. In the ten months Nick Walker had
known Nadine, he had seen nothing less than a complete devotion to
professionalism. ¡°It¡¯s not going to work,¡± he said to his boss back at the home
office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Per Reuben¡¯s
preference, dinner was a lobster salad with pasta shells. He sat next to Nadine
and hung on her every word. He went heavy on the praise for her handling of the
case and the trial. He, along with everyone around the table, was anxiously
awaiting a momentous verdict.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page328></a><span
lang=EN>¡°We¡¯re here to have a conversation,¡± Nick said after the dessert plates
were removed and the door closed. ¡°But first, I would like Nadine to tell us
what¡¯s up next in the courtroom.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Without hesitation,
she began her summary. ¡°We are presuming the plaintiff has no more witnesses.
If the pharmacologist were to appear in the morning, he would be allowed to
testify, but according to our sources Dr. Threadgill is still hiding at home in
Cincinnati. So, the plaintiff should rest its case at 9:00 a.m. At that point,
we have a choice. First, and obvious, is to move for summary judgment. Judge
Seawright allows this to be done both orally and in writing. We¡¯ll do both at
the same time, if we choose to go that route. In my opinion, which is shared by
my trial team, there is an excellent chance Judge Seawright will grant our
motion immediately. The plaintiff has failed to establish even the most basic
elements of a case, and everyone, including the plaintiff¡¯s lawyer, knows this.
Judge Seawright has never liked this case, and, frankly, I get the impression
he can¡¯t wait to toss it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What¡¯s his history
with summary judgment motions made after the plaintiff rests?¡± Reuben asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°In the past twenty
years, he¡¯s granted more than any other federal judge in Chicago and the State
of Illinois. He has zero patience with cases that cannot reach even the lowest
standard of proof.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But I want a
verdict,¡± Reuben said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Then we will
forget summary judgment and start putting on witnesses. We have a lot, you¡¯ve
paid for them, and they will be unimpeachable. But I have a strong feeling that
this jury is fed up.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Absolutely,¡± said
Nick Walker, who had been in the courtroom for every word. ¡°I suspect they¡¯ve
already started their deliberations, in spite of Judge Seawright¡¯s
admonitions.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judy Beck added,
¡°Our consultants feel strongly that we should finish the case as soon as
possible, definitely before the weekend. The verdict is all but in.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Reuben smiled at
Nadine and said, ¡°So, Counselor, what¡¯s your advice?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°For me, a win is a
win. Summary judgment is a slam dunk. If it <a name=page329></a>goes to the
jury, there¡¯s always the risk of a freak accident. I would take the easy way
out, but then I understand there¡¯s more in play here than a ruling by a judge.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How many cases do
you try each year?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Six is the
average. I can¡¯t prepare for more than that, regardless of staff.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And you haven¡¯t
lost in how many years?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Eleven. Sixty-four
wins in a row, but who¡¯s counting?¡± This tired line drew laughs far louder than
it deserved, but everyone needed the humor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Have you ever felt
this confident about a trial and a jury?¡± Reuben asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>She took a sip of
wine and thought for a moment, then shook her head. ¡°Not that I remember.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°If we go all the
way to the verdict, what are our chances of winning?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Everyone watched
her as she took another tiny sip. ¡°A lawyer is not supposed to make these
predictions, Mr. Massey.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But you¡¯re not a
typical lawyer, Ms. Karros.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Ninety-five
percent.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Ninety-nine,¡± Nick
Walker said with a laugh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Reuben took a gulp
of his third Scotch, smacked his lips, and said, ¡°I want a verdict. I want the
jury to deliberate briefly and walk back into that courtroom with a verdict for
Varrick Laboratories. To me, a verdict is repudiation, it¡¯s revenge,
retribution, it¡¯s a lot more than victory. I¡¯ll take the verdict and splash it
all over the world. Our PR people and ad agencies are ready and itching to go.
Koane, our man in Washington, assures me that a verdict will break the logjam at
the FDA and get a reversal. Our lawyers from coast to coast are convinced a
verdict will even further frighten the tort boys and send them running for the
hills. I want a verdict, Nadine. Can you deliver it?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°As I said, Reuben,
I¡¯m 95 percent sure.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Then that settles
it. No summary judgment. Let¡¯s bury these bastards.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>At exactly 9:00 on Thursday morning, a bailiff
called the court to order and all rose for the entrance of His Honor. When the
jury was in place, he said abruptly, ¡°Continue, Mr. Zinc.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David rose and
said, ¡°Your Honor, the plaintiff rests.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright was
not at all surprised. ¡°Lost some more witnesses, Mr. Zinc?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No sir. We¡¯ve
simply run out of them.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Very well. A
motion, Ms. Karros?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, Your Honor, we
are ready to proceed.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I suspected that.
Call your first witness.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David suspected it
too. He had allowed himself to believe that the trial would end abruptly that
morning, but it was obvious Nadine and her client smelled blood. From there on,
he would have little to do but listen and watch a real courtroom lawyer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The defense calls
Dr. Jesse Kindorf.¡± David glanced at the jurors and saw several smiles. They
were about to meet a celebrity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Jesse Kindorf was a
former surgeon general of the United States. He held the position for six years
and was brilliantly controversial. He castigated tobacco companies on a daily
basis. He held large press conferences in which he exposed the fat and caloric
content of popular fast foods. He released scathing condemnations against some
of the most trusted names in corporate America, consumer product companies that
were flat-out guilty of producing and marketing mass quantities <a
name=page331></a>of highly processed foods. At various times during his tenure,
he was on the warpath fighting butter, cheese, eggs, red meat, sugar, soft
drinks, and alcohol, but his most famous brouhaha occurred when he suggested a
ban on coffee. He thoroughly enjoyed the spotlight, and with his good looks,
athletic build, and quick wit he became the most famous surgeon general in
history. The fact that he had crossed the street and was now testifying on
behalf of a major corporation was a clear signal to the jurors that he believed
in the drug.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And he was a
cardiologist, from Chicago. He took the stand and flashed a smile at the jury,
his jury. Nadine began the arduous process of going through his credentials in
order to have him qualified as an expert. David quickly jumped to his feet and
said, ¡°Your Honor, we are happy to stipulate that Dr. Kindorf is an expert in
the field of cardiology.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine turned,
smiled, and said, ¡°Thank you.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Judge Seawright
growled, ¡°Thank you, Mr. Zinc.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The gist of Dr.
Kindorf¡¯s testimony was that he had prescribed Krayoxx to thousands of his
patients over the past few years, with no side effects whatsoever. The drug
worked beautifully for about 90 percent of his patients. The drug dramatically
lowered cholesterol. His ninety-one-year-old mother was on Krayoxx, or was
until it was pulled by the FDA.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The paralegal
scribbled a note on her legal pad and handed it to her boss: ¡°Wonder how much
they¡¯re paying him?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David scribbled
back as if they were discussing a major flaw in the testimony. ¡°A lot.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine Karros and
Dr. Kindorf worked their way through a flawless round of batting practice. She
served up the fat pitches, he knocked them out of the park. The jury wanted to
cheer them on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When Judge
Seawright asked, ¡°Any cross-examination, Mr. Zinc?¡± David rose and politely
said, ¡°No, Your Honor.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>To curry favor with
the blacks on the jury, Nadine called a Dr. Thurston, a dapper, distinguished
black gentleman with a gray beard and finely tailored suit. Dr. Thurston was
also from Chicago and was the senior physician in a group of thirty-five
cardiologists and cardiovascular <a name=page332></a>surgeons. In his spare
time, he taught at the University of Chicago School of Medicine. To move things
along, David did not question his credentials. Dr. Thurston and his group had
prescribed Krayoxx to tens of thousands of their patients over the past six
years, with spectacular results and no side effects. The drug, in his opinion,
was perfectly safe; indeed, he and his colleagues viewed it as a miracle drug.
Its presence was sorely missed, and, yes, he planned to immediately resume
prescribing it when it reappeared on the market. Most dramatically, Dr.
Thurston revealed to the jury that he had taken Krayoxx himself for four years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>To get the
attention of the Hispanic lady on the jury, the defense called Dr. Roberta
Seccero, cardiologist and researcher at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
David gave the green light on credentials, and Dr. Seccero, to no one¡¯s
surprise, sang like a bird on a spring morning. Her patients were mostly women,
and the drug did everything but make them lose weight. There was no statistical
evidence that those taking Krayoxx were likelier to suffer heart attacks or
strokes than those who didn¡¯t take it. She and her colleagues had researched
this at length, and there was no doubt. In her twenty-five years as a
cardiologist, she had never seen a safer and more effective medication.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The rainbow was
completed when Ms. Karros called to the stand a young Korean doctor from San
Francisco who, oddly enough, looked remarkably similar to juror Number 19. Dr.
Pang enthusiastically endorsed the drug and expressed dismay at its removal
from the market. He had given it to hundreds of patients with outstanding
results.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David had no
questions for Dr. Pang either. He was not about to bicker with any of these
renowned doctors. What was he supposed to do&#8212;argue medicine with some of the
best doctors in the business? No sir. He stayed in his chair and kept one eye
on his watch, which was moving rather slowly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There was no doubt
that had there been a juror of Lithuanian descent, Nadine would have pulled
another expert from her magic hat, one with a Lithuanian surname and immaculate
credentials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The fifth witness
was the chief cardiologist at the Feinberg School <a name=page333></a>of
Medicine, Northwestern University. Her name was Dr. Parkin, and her testimony
was a little different. She had been hired to do a thorough analysis of Percy
Klopeck¡¯s medical history. She had reviewed his records from the age of twelve
and those of his siblings and parents to the extent they were available, and
she also had taken recorded statements from his friends and co-workers, those
willing to cooperate. At the time of his death, Percy was taking Prinzide and
Levatol for hypertension, insulin for adult-onset diabetes, Bexnin for
arthritis, Plavix as a blood thinner, Colestid for atherosclerosis, and Krayoxx
for high cholesterol. His happy pill of choice was Xanax, which he either
bummed off friends, stole from Iris, or bought online, and he used it daily to
battle the stress of life with ¡°that woman,¡± according to one of his
co-workers. He occasionally used Fedamin, an over-the-counter appetite
suppressant that was supposed to make him eat less but seemed to backfire. He
had smoked for twenty years but managed to stop at the age of forty-one with
the aid of Nicotrex, a nicotine-laced chewing gum that was known to be highly
addictive. He chewed it nonstop, going through at least three packages a day.
According to blood work a year before he died, Percy¡¯s liver was showing a
decreasing level of function. He loved gin and, according to credit card
records subpoenaed by Ms. Karros, purchased at least three fifths a week from
Bilbo¡¯s Spirits on Stanton Avenue, five blocks from his home. He often felt bad
in the morning, complained of headaches, and kept at least two large bottles of
ibuprofen close by on his cluttered work desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When Dr. Parkin
finished her lengthy narrative about Percy¡¯s habits and health, it seemed
patently unfair to blame his death on just one drug. Since there had been no
autopsy&#8212;Iris had been too upset to even think about it&#8212;there was no positive
indication that he died of a heart attack. His death could have been caused by
the all-encompassing ¡°respiratory failure.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally and Oscar had
discussed having the body exhumed to get a clearer picture of what killed him,
but Iris flew into a rage. Plus, the exhumation, autopsy, and reburial would
have cost almost $10,000, and Oscar flatly refused to spend the money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page334></a><span
lang=EN>In Dr. Parkin¡¯s opinion, Percy Klopeck had died young because he was
genetically predisposed to an early death, one made even more probable because
of his lifestyle. She also offered the opinion that it was impossible to
predict the cumulative effect of the astonishing barrage of his medications.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Poor Percy, thought
David. He lived a short, uneventful life and died peacefully in his sleep, with
no clue whatsoever that his habits and ailments would one day be dissected so
thoroughly by strangers in open court.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Her testimony was
devastating, and there was not a single part of it that David wanted to revisit
on cross-examination. At 12:30, Judge Seawright adjourned until 2:00 p.m. David
and Helen hustled from the courthouse and enjoyed a nice, long lunch. David
ordered a bottle of white wine, and Helen, who rarely drank, enjoyed a glass.
They toasted Percy, may he rest in peace.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In
David¡¯s novice opinion, Nadine and the defense stumbled slightly with the
afternoon¡¯s first witness. He was Dr. Litchfield, a cardiologist and
cardiovascular surgeon from the world-renowned Cleveland Clinic, where he saw
patients, taught, and researched. He had the tedious task of walking the jurors
through Percy¡¯s last echocardiogram, the same video that had knocked them out
in the hands of Igor Borzov. Sensing that another viewing of that footage would
not be well received, Nadine stepped on the gas and opted for a scaled-down
version of the testimony. Bottom line&#8212;there was no reduced regurgitation of
blood from the mitral valve. The left ventricle was not enlarged. If the
patient did indeed die of a heart attack, its cause could not be determined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Bottom line&#8212;Borzov
was a fool.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David had a quick
vision of Wally, lying peacefully in a comfortable bed, wearing a gown or
pajamas or whatever Harbor House distributed, sober now, tranquil due to a
sedative, maybe reading or just <a name=page335></a>gazing at Lake Michigan,
his thoughts a million miles away from the carnage in Courtroom 2314. Yet it
was all his fault. In the months he¡¯d spent racing around Chicago, visiting
low-end funeral parlors, passing out brochures in gyms and fast-food joints, he
had never, not once, paused to study the physiology and pharmacology of Krayoxx
and its alleged damage to heart valves. He had simply and eagerly assumed the
drug was bad and, egged on by smart guys like Jerry Alisandros and other tort
stars, had joined the parade and begun counting his money. Resting now in
rehab, was he even thinking about the trial, about the case getting dumped on
David while he and Oscar were laid up licking their wounds? No, David decided,
Wally was not worrying about the trial. Wally had bigger issues&#8212;sobriety,
bankruptcy, a job, his firm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The next witness
was a professor and medical researcher from Harvard who had studied Krayoxx and
written a definitive article in the <span class=0Text>New England Journal of
Medicine</span>. David managed to get a slight chuckle when he did not question
the professor¡¯s r&eacute;sum&eacute;. He said, ¡°Your Honor, if he went to Harvard, I¡¯m sure
his credentials are outstanding. He must be brilliant.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Fortunately, the
jurors had not been informed that David was a graduate of the Harvard School of
Law; otherwise, the wisecrack could have backfired. Harvard grads who talked
about being Harvard grads were not generally well regarded in Chicago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Pretty stupid,¡±
read the note from the paralegal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David did not
respond. It was almost 4:00 p.m., and he just wanted to leave. The professor
droned on about his research methods. Not a single juror was paying attention.
Most appeared brain-dead, thoroughly numbed by this futile exercise in civic
responsibility. If this is what made a democracy strong, then God help us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David wondered if
they were already discussing the case. Each morning and each afternoon Judge
Seawright gave the same lecture about improper contact, the prohibition against
reading about the case in the newspapers or online, and the need to refrain
from chatting about the case until all evidence had been presented. There were <a
name=page336></a>plenty of studies on the behavior of juries, the dynamics of
group decision making, and so on, and most found that jurors couldn¡¯t wait to
begin gossiping about the lawyers, the witnesses, even the judge. They tended
to pair off, to buddy up, to separate into cliques and camps and begin their
considerations prematurely. Seldom, though, did they do so as an entire group.
More often, they hid their little private sessions from each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David tuned out his
fellow Harvard alum and flipped a few pages of his legal pad. He resumed work
on a rough draft of his letter:</span></p>

<p class=Para05 style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Dear So-and-So:</span></p>

<p class=Para05 style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>I represent the family
of Thuya Khaing, the five-year-old son of two Burmese immigrants who are in
this country legally</span><span class=0Text><span lang=EN style='font-style:

<p class=Para05 style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>From November 20 until
May 19 of this year, Thuya was a patient in the Lakeshore Children¡¯s Hospital
here in Chicago. He had ingested a near-lethal amount of lead, and on several
occasions was kept alive by a respirator. According to his doctors, and I have
included with this letter a summary of their statements, Thuya now suffers
brain damage that is permanent and severe. He is not expected to live but a few
more years; however, there is a chance he could survive up to twenty years</span><span

<p class=Para05 style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The source of the lead

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When Wally looked

this, David. I thought I had it whipped, I swear I did. One year, two weeks,
two days, then something happened. We were in court Monday morning, I was
nervous as hell, terrified really, and I was overcome with this vicious desire
for a drink. I remember thinking, you know, a couple of drinks will do the
trick. Two quick beers and I¡¯ll settle down. Alcohol is such a liar, such a
monster. As soon as we broke for lunch, I scooted out of the building and found
a little caf&eacute; with a beer sign in the window. I got a table, ordered a
sandwich, drank three beers, and, wow, it tasted so good. And felt even better.
Back in the courtroom, I remember thinking, you know, I can do this. I can
drink and it¡¯s no problem. I got it whipped, you know? No problem. Now look at
me. Back in rehab and scared shitless.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Emma had a rough night, and both parents walked
the floor in alternating one-hour shifts. When Helen handed her off at 5:30 and
headed back to bed, she announced her career as a paralegal was mercifully
over. She had enjoyed the lunches, but little else, and besides, she had a sick
baby to deal with. David managed to quiet Emma with a bottle and, as he fed
her, went online. Varrick¡¯s stock had closed at $40 a share Thursday afternoon.
Its steady rise throughout the week was even more evidence that the Klopeck
trial was going badly for the plaintiff, though no additional evidence was
really needed. Out of his usual morbid curiosity, David checked in with the
Hung Juror, who wrote:</span></p>

<p class=Para12 style='margin-top:.05in;margin-right:12.0pt;margin-bottom:.05in;
margin-left:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In what has to be the most
lopsided trial in the history of U.S. jurisprudence, things continue to go from
bad to worse for the estate of the late and now much maligned Percy Klopeck. As
Varrick Labs¡¯ defense team continues to steamroll over the hapless and grossly
incompetent lawyer for Klopeck, one almost feels sorry for the underdog.
Almost, but not quite. The question that screams to be answered is, how did
this dog of a case manage to get into court, stay in court, and stumble its way
to the jury? Talk about an obscene waste of time, money, and talent! Talent,
that is, for the defense. Talent is sorely lacking on the other side of the
courtroom, where the clueless David Zinc has adopted the unique strategy of
simply trying to become invisible. He has yet to cross-examine a <a
name=page341></a>witness. He has yet to make an objection. He has yet to make a
single move to help his case. He just sits there for hours, pretending to take
notes, swapping little messages with his new paralegal, a hot thing in a short
skirt brought in to show some leg and try to divert attention from the fact
that the plaintiff has no case and the lawyer is incompetent. Unknown to the
jury, the new paralegal is actually Helen Zinc, wife of the idiot sitting in
front of her. This bimbo is not a paralegal and has no training or experience
in the courtroom, so she fits in nicely with the clowns from Finley &amp; Figg.
Her presence is obviously a clever ploy to catch the eye of the male jurors and
counterbalance the overwhelming presence of Nadine Karros, who is perhaps the
most effective courtroom advocate this Hung Juror has ever watched.</span></p>

margin-left:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Let¡¯s hope this dog is put
to sleep today. And maybe Judge Seawright has the guts to grant sanctions for
such a frivolous case.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David
flinched so hard he squeezed Emma, who momentarily stopped working the bottle.
He closed his laptop and cursed himself for looking at the blog. Never again,
he vowed, not for the first time.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With
the verdict solidly in hand, Nadine Karros decided to push a bit harder. Her
first witness Friday morning was Dr. Mark Ulander, Varrick¡¯s senior vice
president and director of research. Working from a script, they quickly laid
the groundwork. Ulander had three graduate degrees and had spent the past
twenty-two years supervising Varrick¡¯s vast development of myriad drugs.
Krayoxx was his proudest achievement. The company had spent over $4 billion
bringing it to market. His team of thirty scientists had labored for eight
years to perfect the drug, to make certain it worked to lower cholesterol, to
take no chances with its safety, and to gain FDA approval. He detailed the
rigid testing procedures used, and not just for Krayoxx but for all Varrick¡¯s
fine products. The company¡¯s reputation was on the line with every drug it
developed, and the Varrick reputation for excellence pervaded every <a
name=page342></a>aspect of his research. With Nadine¡¯s skillful direction, Dr.
Ulander painted an impressive picture of a diligent effort to produce the
perfect drug, Krayoxx.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With nothing to
lose, David decided to roll the dice and join the action. He began his
cross-examination with ¡°Dr. Ulander, let¡¯s talk about all of those clinical
trials you just mentioned.¡± The fact that David was at the podium seemed to
catch the jurors off guard. Though it was only 10:15, they were ready to deliberate
and go home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Where did the
clinical trials take place?¡± David asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°For Krayoxx?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, for baby

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Why should we talk
about other drugs, Mr. Zinc?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, Judge, it
seems to me as if this witness has placed the company¡¯s reputation into issue.
He testified for sixty-four minutes and spent most of his time trying to
convince the jury that his company places great importance on safe testing
procedures. Why can¡¯t I explore this? It seems quite relevant to me, and I
think the jury would find it interesting.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>To which Nadine
quickly replied, ¡°Your Honor, this trial is about a drug called Krayoxx,
nothing more. Anything else is a fishing expedition.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But as Mr. Zinc
correctly pointed out, you placed the company¡¯s reputation into issue, Ms.
Karros. You weren¡¯t required to do this, but that door is now open. Objection
overruled. Continue, Mr. Zinc.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The door was indeed
open, and Varrick¡¯s history was fair game. <a name=page346></a>David wasn¡¯t
certain how it had happened, but he was thrilled nonetheless. His self-doubt
was gone. The gnawing fear had disappeared. He was on his feet, all alone
against the big boys, and he was scoring points. It was showtime.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I asked about
Amoxitrol, Dr. Ulander. Surely you remember it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With a bit of
flair, David waved his arm at the jury and said, ¡°Well, tell the jury about
that drug. What was it intended to do?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ulander sank a few
inches in the witness chair and again looked at the defense table for help.
Grudgingly, he began talking, but in very short sentences. ¡°Amoxitrol was
developed as an abortion pill.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>To help him along,
David asked, ¡°An abortion pill that could be taken up to one month after
conception, sort of an expanded version of the morning-after pill, right,
Doctor?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Something like
that.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Was that a yes or
a no?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The pill would
basically dissolve the fetus, and its remains would eventually be flushed out

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°In a simplified
form, yes, that is what the drug was supposed to do.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With at least seven
Catholics on the jury, David didn¡¯t have to glance over to see how this was
being received.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Did you conduct
clinical trials for Amoxitrol?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And where did

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ulander rolled his

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David walked slowly
to his table, riffled through some papers, and extracted a binder. He opened
it, flipped pages as he walked back to <a name=page347></a>the podium, and
asked, as though he were reading from the report, ¡°In what three African
countries did Varrick conduct clinical trials for its abortion pill Amoxitrol?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Uganda for sure. I

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°How many African

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And how much money

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Don¡¯t guess,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David flipped a
page, took his time, let the pathetic amount of the bounty rattle around the
courtroom. Nadine Karros rose again and said, ¡°Your Honor, I object. The report

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David snapped, ¡°Oh,

seen it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What report are

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s an
investigation done by the World Health Organization in 2002. Their scientists
tracked the world¡¯s largest pharmaceutical companies and the way they use human

countries.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The judge held up
both hands and said, ¡°That¡¯s enough. You can¡¯t use the report if it¡¯s not in

it as evidence, Your Honor. I¡¯m using it to impeach this witness and question
the fine reputation of this wonderful company.¡± By now, David felt no restraint
in choosing his words. What was there to lose?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page348></a><span
lang=EN>Judge Seawright frowned and scratched his chin some more, obviously
uncertain. ¡°Ms. Karros,¡± he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He¡¯s picking facts
from a report that¡¯s not in evidence, a report the jury will not see, unless he

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Here¡¯s what we are
going to do, Mr. Zinc. You can use the report for impeachment purposes only,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure, Judge. Would
you like a copy of the report?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That would be
helpful.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David walked to his
table, picked up two more binders, and as he sort of strutted around the
courtroom, he said, ¡°I have an extra copy for Varrick, though I¡¯m sure they¡¯ve

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s enough of
the extraneous comments, Mr. Zinc,¡± His Honor barked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David said,
¡°Sorry.¡± He handed a copy to the judge and then tossed one on the table in
front of Nadine Karros. Back at the podium, he looked at his notes, then glared
at Dr. Ulander. ¡°Now, Doctor, back to Amoxitrol. When Varrick was testing the
drug, was your company concerned with the ages of these young pregnant African
women?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For a few seconds,
Ulander was unable to speak. He finally mumbled, ¡°I¡¯m sure we were.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Great. So how
young was too young, Dr. Ulander? What were Varrick¡¯s guidelines on age?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The subjects were
required to be at least eighteen years old.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Have you ever seen
this report, Doctor?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ulander again
looked desperately at Nadine Karros, who, along with the rest of her squad, was
cowering and making eye contact with no one. Finally, he uttered an
unconvincing ¡°No.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Juror Number 37, a
fifty-one-year-old black male, made a hissing sound that was meant to be heard

respond.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Reuben
Massey was sitting next to Judy Beck in the first row, defense side. As a
seasoned veteran of the tort wars, he knew it was crucial to maintain a veneer
of complete calm and confidence. But his heart pounded with anger, and he
wanted to leap forward and grab Nadine Karros by the neck. How was this
happening? How had this door been not only cracked but kicked wide open?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Varrick could have
easily won on summary judgment, and he would be back at his desk, safely
ensconced at corporate HQ relishing the victory and pulling strings to get

thrashed by an absolute novice.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You failed to

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page350></a><span

courtroom was silent. ¡°Now, Dr. Ulander, from Varrick¡¯s sample of four hundred
pregnant women, how many died from abdominal bleeding?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The witness slowly
removed his glasses and placed them in his lap. He rubbed his eyes, glanced at

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David hung his head
for a moment, then took a load of paperwork to his table and swapped it for
another stack of papers. He had no idea how far he could go at this point, but
he was not quitting until instructed to do so. He returned to the podium,
arranged things, and said, ¡°Now, Doctor, let¡¯s talk about some of Varrick¡¯s
other drugs that did make it into the marketplace.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ms. Karros stood and

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David held up his

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>With three blacks on the jury, David made the
tactical decision to spend more time in Africa with Dr. Ulander. During the
recess, Judge Seawright decided to allow David to explore the backgrounds of
only three additional drugs. ¡°I want the jury to get this case this afternoon,¡±
he said. Ms. Karros was still objecting, hotly at times, and the judge was
still overruling her objections.</span></p>

Zinc. It will be admitted.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Mr. Zinc plowed on:
¡°The memo is dated May 4, 2002, correct, Dr. Ulander?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Correct.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So, some two
months after Varrick began its clinical trials in Africa, this memo comes
across your desk. Look at the second page, last paragraph. Would you please
read that to the jury, Dr. Ulander?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The witness
obviously didn¡¯t want to read anything, but he adjusted his glasses and began:
¡°Patients have been taking Klervex for six weeks, forty milligrams, twice
daily. Seventy-two percent show decreased blood pressure, systolic and
diastolic. Side effects are worrisome. Patients complain of dizziness, nausea,
vomiting, and many, approximately 20 percent, suffer severe headaches so
debilitating it is necessary to stop the drug. After comparing notes with other
med techs here in Nairobi, I strongly suggest that all trials be suspended for
Klervex.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page354></a><span
lang=EN>¡°Now, Dr. Ulander, were the trials suspended?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, they were
not.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Were there similar
reports from the field?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ulander sighed and
looked at the defense table, helpless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I have copies of
the other reports, Dr. Ulander, if they might refresh your memory,¡± David
offered helpfully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, there were other
reports,¡± Ulander said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And this
technician, Darlene Ainsworth, is she still employed by Varrick?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t think so.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Is that a yes or a
no, Doctor?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, she is not
employed.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Isn¡¯t it true, Dr.
Ulander, that she was terminated one month after sending you this memo about
the horrors of Klervex?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She wasn¡¯t
terminated by me.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But she was
terminated by Varrick, wasn¡¯t she?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, I¡¯m not sure
how she left the company. She may have resigned.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David again walked
to his table and picked up a thick document. He looked at Judge Seawright and
said, ¡°Judge, this is Dr. Ulander¡¯s deposition from the Klervex litigation two
years ago. May I use it to refresh his memory?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Just answer the
question,¡± the judge snapped angrily at the witness. ¡°Was this employee
terminated by Varrick one month after she sent you that memo?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Startled by the
rebuke from His Honor, Dr. Ulander¡¯s memory was instantly refreshed, and he
said, ¡°Yes, she was.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thank you,¡± the
judge said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David looked at the
jury as he spoke. ¡°So, in spite of these warnings from the field, Varrick
pushed on and gained FDA approval in 2005, right, Dr. Ulander?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°The drug was
approved in 2005.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And once it was
approved, Varrick aggressively marketed the drug in this country, right, Dr.
Ulander?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page355></a><span
lang=EN>¡°I have nothing to do with marketing.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°But you are on the
board, right?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Right.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Then all hell
broke loose. Complaining of severe migraines and other side effects, at least
eight thousand Varrick consumers filed lawsuits in 2005, right, Doctor?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t have
access to those numbers.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, let¡¯s not
nitpick here, Doctor. I¡¯ll try to wrap this up a bit quicker. Has your company
gone to trial anywhere in this country to defend its drug Klervex?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Once.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And Varrick has
settled over twenty-five thousand lawsuits for the drug as of last week, right,
Doctor?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine was back.
¡°Objection, Your Honor. Settlements in other cases are not relevant to this
one. I think Mr. Zinc has stepped over the line.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll decide that,
Ms. Karros. But your objection is sustained. Mr. Zinc, no talk of other
settlements.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thank you, Your
Honor. Now, Dr. Ulander, do you recall a Varrick drug called Ruval?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ulander sighed
again and began to study his feet. David walked to his table to reshuffle his
files and fetch another stack of memos extracted from Varrick¡¯s dirty laundry.
In short order, he established that (1) Ruval was supposed to alleviate
migraine headaches but it also dramatically increased blood pressure; (2) it
had been tested on migraine sufferers in Africa and India; (3) Varrick knew of
its side effects but tried to bury this information; (4) damaging internal
company memos were discovered by trial lawyers in the ensuing litigation; (5)
the FDA had eventually recalled the drug; (6) Varrick was still defending various
class actions and not a single case had gone to trial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At 1:00 p.m., David
made the decision to quit. He had grilled Dr. Ulander unmercifully for almost
three hours, with no counterpunch from Ms. Karros, and he had scored enough
points. The jury, at first <a name=page356></a>amused by the dirt on Varrick,
now seemed ready to eat lunch, deliberate, and go home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A quick lunch,¡±
the judge said. ¡°Back here at 2:00 p.m.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David
found an empty corner of the caf&eacute; on the second floor of the building and was
eating a sandwich and looking over his notes when he felt someone approach from
behind. It was Taylor Barkley, a Rogan associate, one of the few David had met
and occasionally nodded to across the courtroom. ¡°Got a second?¡± he said as he
slid into a chair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Nice cross. Nadine
makes few mistakes, but that was a big one.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thanks,¡± David
said, chewing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Barkley¡¯s eyes
darted around as if they were swapping crucial secrets. ¡°Have you come across a
blogger who calls himself the Hung Juror?¡± David nodded, and Barkley continued:
¡°Our tech guys are very good, and they¡¯ve tracked him down. He¡¯s in the
courtroom, three rows behind you, navy sweater, white shirt, thirty years old,
balding, glasses, pretty nerdy looking. Name¡¯s Aaron Deentz, used to work for a
mid-range firm downtown but got whacked in the recession. Now he blogs and
tries to be important, can¡¯t seem to find a job.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Why are you
telling me this?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°He has the right
to blog; the courtroom is open to the public. Most of his stuff is harmless,
but he took a shot at your wife. Me, I¡¯d deck him. Just thought you¡¯d want to
know. See you around.¡± And with that, Barkley eased away and was gone.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At
2:00 p.m., Nadine Karros stood and announced, ¡°Your Honor, the defense rests.¡±
This had been discussed in chambers and was no surprise. Judge Seawright wasted
no time and said, ¡°Mr. Zinc, you may address the jury in closing statement.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David had no desire
to address the jury and ask for compassion for his client, Iris Klopeck, but it
would be extremely awkward for <a name=page357></a>a lawyer who had tried a
case from beginning to end to waive final argument. He stood at the podium and
began by thanking the jurors for their service. Then he confessed that this was
his first trial, and, frankly, he had not planned on doing anything but
research. However, events had conspired to thrust him into this arena, and he
felt bad for not doing a better job. He held up a document and explained that
it was the pretrial order, sort of an outline for the trial that both sides
agree on long before the jury is selected. Of interest, on page 35, was a list
of the experts for the defense. Twenty-seven! All with the word ¡°Doctor¡±
attached somewhere to their names. Thankfully, the defense did not call all
twenty-seven, but they certainly hired and paid them. Why would any defendant
need so many well-paid experts? Perhaps the defendant had something to hide.
And why would the defendant need so many lawyers, David asked, waving an arm at
the Rogan Rothberg team? His client, Iris Klopeck, could not afford such
talent. The field was not level. The game was rigged. Only the jury could
equalize things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He spoke less than
ten minutes and happily left the podium. As he walked back to the table, he
glanced at the spectators and made eye contact with Aaron Deentz, the Hung
Juror. David stared at him for a few seconds, then Deentz looked away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Nadine Karros
argued for thirty minutes and managed to shift the attention back to Krayoxx
and away from those other unpleasant tests Mr. Zinc had talked about. She
vigorously defended Varrick and reminded the jurors of the many well-known and
trusted drugs the company had given to the world. Including Krayoxx, a drug
that had survived the week nicely since the plaintiff had failed miserably to
prove there was anything wrong with it. Yes, she and Varrick may have
twenty-seven noted experts in their lineup, but that was beside the point. Much
more important was the expert proof offered by the plaintiff, who filed the
lawsuit and had the burden of building a case and had thoroughly failed to do
so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David watched her
performance with great admiration. She was smooth and skilled, and her trial
experience was obvious from the way <a name=page358></a>she moved around,
spoke, chose her words effortlessly, looked at the jurors, smiled at them, and
trusted them. From their faces, there was little doubt they trusted her too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David waived his
rebuttal argument. Judge Seawright went straight to the reading of the jury
instructions, the most tedious segment of any trial. At 3:30, the jury was led
from the courtroom to begin its deliberations. David wanted to get away, so he
carried a large box of his documents to his SUV in the garage. As he was riding
the elevator back up to the twenty-third floor, his cell phone vibrated. The
text message said: ¡°The jury is ready.¡± He smiled and whispered, ¡°That didn¡¯t
take long.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When the courtroom
was quiet, a bailiff brought in the jury. The foreman handed the written
verdict to the clerk, who gave it to Judge Seawright, who said, ¡°The verdict
appears to be in order.¡± It was returned to the foreman, who stood and read,
¡°We, the jury, find for the defendant, Varrick Laboratories.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>There was no
reaction from anyone in the courtroom. Judge Seawright went through his
post-verdict rituals and released the jurors. David had no desire to hang
around and suffer through the happy horseshit of ¡°Nice job,¡± ¡°Tough set of
facts,¡± ¡°Better luck next time.¡± As soon as the judge tapped his gavel and
adjourned court, David lifted his heavy briefcase and dashed from the room. He
beat the crowd and was hustling down the hall when he caught a glimpse of a
familiar blue sweater entering a restroom. David followed, and once inside he
scanned the room and saw no one but Aaron Deentz. David washed his hands,
waited, and when Deentz finished at the urinal, he turned and saw David.
¡°You¡¯re the Hung Juror, right?¡± David said, and Deentz froze, unmasked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°So what?¡± Deentz
said with a sneer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David cocked his
arm and shot a right cross that landed perfectly on the fleshy left jaw of the
Hung Juror, who was too stunned to react. He grunted as his jaw popped. David
followed with a quick left hook that landed on the nose. ¡°That¡¯s for the bimbo,
you ass!¡± David said, as Deentz fell to the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page359></a><span
lang=EN>David left the restroom and saw a crowd at the far end of the hall. He
found the stairs and sprinted down to the main lobby. He dashed across the
street to the garage and was safely locked in his SUV before he took a deep
breath and said, ¡°You idiot.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After
a circuitous route back to the office, David arrived late on Friday afternoon.
To his surprise, Oscar was sitting at the table having a soft drink with
Rochelle. He looked thin and pale, but he had a smile and said he was feeling
okay. His doctor had cleared him to spend no more than two hours a day at the
office, and he claimed he was eager to get back to work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David gave a highly
condensed version of the trial. He mimicked the Russian accent of Dr. Borzov,
and this drew laughter. All jokes were on Finley &amp; Figg after all, so why
not laugh at themselves. When he described his frantic efforts to find Dr.
Threadgill, they laughed some more. They could not believe that Helen had been
drafted into service. When he described the faces of the jurors during Iris¡¯s
video, Rochelle wiped her eyes with a tissue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And in spite of my
brilliant performance, the jury reached its verdict in only seventeen minutes.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When the humor was
gone, they talked about Wally, their fallen comrade. They talked about the
bills, the line of credit, their bleak future. Oscar suggested they forget
about it until Monday morning. ¡°We¡¯ll figure out something,¡± he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David and Rochelle
were startled at how thoughtful and kind he had become. Perhaps the heart
attack and surgery had softened him up and provided a glimpse of his own
mortality. The old Oscar would have been cussing Figg and griping about the
firm¡¯s imminent financial ruin, but the new one seemed oddly optimistic about
their situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After an hour of
the most pleasant conversation David had experienced around the office, he said
he needed to go. His paralegal was waiting with dinner and wanted to know about
the trial.</span></p>

<p class=0Block style='page-break-before:always'><a name="calibre_pb_0_47"></a><a

CHAPTER_47'><span lang=EN>CHAPTER 47</span></span></h1>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Over the weekend David puttered around the house,
ran errands for Helen, pushed Emma through the neighborhood in her stroller,
washed and shined both vehicles, and kept an eye on the online buzz about the
trial and Varrick¡¯s great victory. There had been a small story in Saturday¡¯s <span
class=0Text>Sun-Times</span> and not a word in the <span class=0Text>Tribune</span>.
The online publications, though, were busy with the aftershocks. Varrick¡¯s
public relations machinery was in full swing, and the verdict was being
described as a major vindication of Krayoxx. CEO Reuben Massey was quoted
everywhere touting the drug, condemning the mass tort bar, promising to crush
¡°those ambulance chasers¡± in any courtroom they dared to enter, praising the wisdom
of the Chicago jurors, and clamoring for more laws to protect innocent
corporations from such frivolous lawsuits. Jerry Alisandros was unavailable for
comment. Indeed, there were no comments from any of the lawyers suing Varrick
Labs. ¡°For the first time in recent history, the entire tort bar has gone
silent,¡± observed one reporter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The call came at
2:00 on Sunday afternoon. Dr. Biff Sandroni had received the samples of Nasty
Teeth by FedEx on Friday morning, about the time David was grilling Dr. Ulander
on the stand. Dr. Sandroni had promised to test the samples immediately.
¡°They¡¯re all the same, David, all coated with the same lead-based paint. Highly
toxic. Your lawsuit is a cinch. Open and shut, the best I¡¯ve ever seen.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°When can you
finish the report?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page361></a><span
lang=EN>¡°I¡¯ll e-mail it tomorrow.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thanks, Biff.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good luck.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>An hour later,
David and Helen loaded Emma into her car seat and set off for Waukegan. The
purpose of the trip was to check on Wally, but there was the added benefit of
having the baby finally go to sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After four days of
sobriety, Wally looked rested and was eager to leave Harbor House. David
recapped the trial and, not wanting to repeat himself and not entirely in the
mood for humor, omitted the parts that Oscar and Rochelle had found so funny
Friday afternoon. Wally apologized repeatedly until David asked him to stop.
¡°It¡¯s over, Wally. We have to move on.¡± They talked about ways to unload their
Krayoxx clients and the problems this might create. It really didn¡¯t matter how
complicated things became&#8212;their decision was final. They were finished with
Krayoxx and Varrick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t need to
stay here any longer,¡± Wally said. They were alone at the end of the hallway.
Helen had stayed behind in the car with the sleeping baby.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What does your
counselor say?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m getting tired
of the guy. Look, David, I fell off the wagon because of the pressure, that¡¯s
all. I consider myself sober right now. I¡¯m already counting the days. I¡¯ll
jump back into AA and hope and pray I won¡¯t fall off again. Hear me, David. I
don¡¯t like being a drunk. We got our work cut out for us, and I gotta stay
sober.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>With his portion of
the meter ticking at $500 a day, David wanted Wally out as soon as possible,
but he was not convinced a ten-day detox would work. ¡°I¡¯ll talk to the
counselor&#8212;what¡¯s his name?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Patrick Hale. He¡¯s
really beating me up this time.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Maybe that¡¯s what
you need, Wally.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Come on, David.
Get me outta here. We¡¯ve dug a hole for ourselves, and it¡¯s just you and me
this time. I¡¯m not so sure Oscar will be much help.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Left unsaid was the
fact that Oscar had been the great skeptic about Krayoxx and mass torts in
general. The deep hole in which they now <a name=page362></a>found themselves
had been dug by Wallis T. Figg. They talked about Oscar for a while, his divorce,
his health, his new girlfriend, who was not really that new, according to
Wally, though David did not press for details.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As he left, Wally
pleaded again, ¡°Get me outta here, David. We have too much work to do.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David hugged him
good-bye and left the visitors¡¯ room. The ¡°work¡± Wally kept referring to was
little more than the imposing task of getting rid of four hundred or so
dissatisfied clients, mopping up the remains of the Klopeck trial, grappling
with a lot of unpaid bills, and laboring away in a building now burdened with a
$200,000 mortgage. In the past month, the firm¡¯s other clients had been
neglected, many to the point of hiring other lawyers, and the daily inquiries
from prospective clients had declined dramatically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David had thought
of leaving, of opening his own shop, or looking at other, smaller firms. If he
walked away, he would, of course, take the Thuya Khaing case with him. Oscar
and Wally would never know about it. If the case eventually paid off, David
could write a check to Finley &amp; Figg for his share of the mortgage on the
building. But these thoughts were bothersome. He had run away from one firm and
never looked back. If he ran away from the second one, he would always have
regrets. In reality, David knew he could not leave Finley &amp; Figg with the
two partners ailing and a swarm of unhappy clients and creditors pounding on
the door.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The
phones rang constantly Monday morning. Rochelle answered a few times, then
announced, ¡°It¡¯s all those Krayoxx people, asking about their cases.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Unplug it,¡± David
said, and the racket stopped. The old Oscar was making a comeback. He was in
his office, door tightly closed, shoving paperwork around his desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>By 9:00 a.m., David
had composed a letter to be mailed to the four hundred or so clients who only
thought they had a lawsuit. It read:</span></p>

<p class=Para05 style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page363></a><span lang=EN>Dear
_______:</span></p>

<p class=Para05 style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Last week our firm
tried the first lawsuit against Varrick Labs for its drug Krayoxx. The trial
did not go as planned and was not successful. The jury ruled in favor of
Varrick. With all the evidence now presented, it is clear that additional
litigation against the company would be ill-advised. For that reason, we are
withdrawing as your counsel. Feel free to consult with another attorney</span><span
class=0Text><span lang=EN style='font-style:normal'>.</span></span></p>

<p class=Para05 style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For what it¡¯s worth,
Varrick presented convincing proof that Krayoxx does not damage the heart
valves, or any other part of the body</span><span class=0Text><span lang=EN

<p class=Para05 style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Sincerely</span><span

<p class=Para05 style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Attorney and
Counselor-at-Law</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When
Rochelle¡¯s printer began spitting out the letters, David went upstairs to
prepare for another fight in federal court, which, on that Monday morning, was
the last place he wanted to go. He had a rough draft of a lawsuit to be filed
against Sonesta Games and a rough draft of a letter he planned to send to the
company¡¯s chief in-house counsel. He polished and tweaked both as he waited on
Sandroni¡¯s report.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Varrick¡¯s stock
opened at $42.50 on Monday morning, its highest value in over two years. David
scanned the financial sites and blogs, and they were still buzzing with
speculation about the future of Krayoxx litigation. Since David had no role in
that future, he was losing interest fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He searched the
near-impenetrable Web site of Cook County&#8212;Courts&#8212;Criminal&#8212;Warrants &amp;
Affidavits and found no record of a complaint for assault filed by one Aaron
Deentz. On Saturday, the Hung Juror had blogged about the ending of the Klopeck
trial but did not mention getting punched out in the men¡¯s restroom on the
twenty-third floor of the Dirksen Federal Building.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar had a friend
who had a friend who worked in Warrants &amp; Affidavits, and this friend was
supposedly on the lookout for a filing by Deentz. ¡°You really decked him?¡±
Oscar had asked with genuine admiration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page364></a><span
lang=EN>¡°Yes, a stupid thing to do.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Don¡¯t worry. It¡¯s
just simple assault. I got friends.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When Sandroni¡¯s
report arrived, David read it carefully and almost salivated at its conclusion:
¡°The levels of lead in the paint used in coating the Nasty Teeth toys are of
toxic levels. Any child, or person, using this product in the exact manner in
which it was designed to be used, to wit, insertion into the mouth, over the
real teeth, would face the grave risks of ingesting quantities of lead-based
paint.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For good measure,
Dr. Sandroni added: ¡°In thirty years of testing products for sources of
poisoning, primarily lead poisoning, I have never seen a product so grossly and
negligently designed and produced.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David copied the
six-page report and placed it in a binder with color photos of the original set
of Nasty Teeth used by Thuya and photos of the samples David had purchased the
week before. He added a copy of the lawsuit and a medical summary prepared by
Thuya¡¯s doctors. In a pleasant but straightforward letter to a Mr. Dylan Kott,
chief in-house counsel for Sonesta Games, David offered to discuss the matter
before filing suit. However, this offer was good for fourteen days only. The
family had suffered greatly, continued to suffer, and was entitled to immediate
relief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When he left for
lunch, he took the binder and shipped it to Sonesta Games by FedEx, overnight
priority. No one else at the firm knew what he was doing. For contact
information in the letter, he used his home address and cell phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar was leaving
as David returned, and his chauffeur was a tiny little woman of dubious
ethnicity. At first David thought she was Thai, then she appeared more
Hispanic. Regardless, she was pleasant to chat with on the front sidewalk. She
was at least twenty years younger than Oscar, and during the brief conversation
David got the clear impression that the two had known each other for some time.
Oscar, who looked quite frail after an easy morning at the office, slowly
folded himself into the passenger¡¯s seat of her little Honda, and away they
went.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who is that?¡±
David asked Rochelle as he closed the front door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page365></a><span
lang=EN>¡°I just met her myself. Some weird name I didn¡¯t get either. She told
me she¡¯s known Oscar for three years.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Wally¡¯s skirt
chasing is well-known. I¡¯m kinda surprised about Oscar. Are you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle smiled and
said, ¡°David, when it comes to love and sex, nothing surprises me.¡± She held
out a pink phone message slip. ¡°While we¡¯re on the subject, you might want to
call this guy.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Who is it?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Goodloe Stamm.
Paula Finley¡¯s divorce lawyer.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t know a
thing about divorce law, Rochelle.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Rochelle gave an
exaggerated look around the room, around the offices, and said, ¡°They¡¯re all
gone. I guess you¡¯d better learn fast.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Stamm began with a
sappy ¡°Too bad about the verdict, but I really wasn¡¯t surprised.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Nor was I,¡± David
said tersely. ¡°What can I do for you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, first of
all, how¡¯s Mr. Finley?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Oscar¡¯s fine. His
heart attack was only two weeks ago today. He actually came to the office this
morning for a few hours, and he¡¯s making steady progress. I suppose you¡¯re
calling to ask about the Krayoxx litigation and hoping there might still be a
chance of some fees coming our way. The answer, unfortunately for us, for our
clients, and for Mrs. Finley as well, is that there is no prospect of making a
dime off these cases. We are not going to appeal the Klopeck verdict. We are in
the process of notifying all of our Krayoxx clients that we are withdrawing as
counsel. We hocked the office to finance the trial, which cost us about
$180,000 in cash. The senior partner is recovering from a heart attack and
bypass surgery. The junior partner has taken a leave of absence. The firm is
now being run by me and one secretary, who by the way knows a lot more about
the law than I do. In case you¡¯re curious about Mr. Finley¡¯s assets, let me
assure you that he has never been broker than he is right now. As I understand
his offer to your client, he is willing to give her the house, all the
furnishings, her car, half the cash in the bank, which was less than $5,000, in
return for a simple, <a name=page366></a>uncontested divorce. He just wants
out, Mr. Stamm. I suggest you and your client take this offer before he changes
his mind.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Stamm digested this
and finally said, ¡°Well, I appreciate your candor.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good. Here¡¯s some
more. On behalf of your felonious client Justin Bardall, you¡¯ve filed a lawsuit
against Oscar Finley for that unfortunate shooting incident. As I read the
file, your client is headed back to prison for attempted arson. As I mentioned,
Mr. Finley is quite broke. His insurance company is refusing coverage because
it deems his actions intentional, as opposed to negligent. So, with no
insurance coverage and no personal assets, Mr. Finley is judgment-proof. You
cannot squeeze a nickel out of him. Your lawsuit is worthless.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What about the
office building?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Heavily mortgaged.
Look, Mr. Stamm, you cannot get a verdict, because your client is a
twice-convicted felon who was caught in the act of trying to commit a crime.
Extremely lousy jury appeal. But if you got lucky and got a verdict, Mr. Finley
would file for bankruptcy the next day. You can¡¯t touch him, you understand?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I get the picture.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We have nothing
and we are hiding nothing. Please have a chat with Mrs. Finley and Mr. Bardall
and explain this to them. I would love to close these files as soon as
possible.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Okay, okay. I¡¯ll
see what I can do.¡±</span></p>

CHAPTER_48'><span lang=EN>CHAPTER 48</span></span></h1>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>A week passed with no word from Sonesta Games.
David watched the calendar and the clock. He fought the urge to dream of a
quick settlement, and he dreaded the idea of filing a lawsuit in federal court
against a large corporation. That treacherous road had just been traveled. At
times he felt like the old Wally&#8212;lost in dreams of easy money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The firm slowly
returned to a routine that somewhat resembled the old days. Rochelle arrived at
7:30 each morning and enjoyed her quiet time with AC. David was next, then Wally,
whose car had been towed during the drinking spree and was not damaged. Oscar
rolled in around ten, delivered to the front door by his girlfriend, a charming
lady who managed to impress even Rochelle. At some point each morning, Wally
faced each of his colleagues and said, ¡°Day 12 of sobriety.¡± Then Day 13, and
so on. He received congratulations and encouragement and was once again proud
of himself. He found an AA meeting almost every night somewhere in the city.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The phones were
still ringing with calls from disgruntled Krayoxx clients, all of whom Rochelle
routed to Wally and David. The ex-clients were generally subdued, even pitiful,
as opposed to belligerent. They had been expecting money&#8212;what happened? The
lawyers were apologetic and tended to blame things on some mysterious ¡°federal
jury¡± that had ruled in favor of the drug. The lawyers were also quick to point
out that ¡°it had been proven in court¡± that Krayoxx was safe. <a name=page368></a>In
other words, your lawsuit is gone but your heart is much healthier than you
thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Similar
conversations were being repeated across the country as dozens of high-flying
lawyers backtracked from the drug. A lawyer in Phoenix filed a motion to
dismiss four lawsuits involving clients allegedly killed by Krayoxx. His motion
met a Rule 11 response straight from the Nadine Karros playbook. Varrick Labs
demanded sanctions for the filing of the frivolous cases and provided detailed
billing and expense records to prove it had spent over $8 million defending the
lawsuits. With the mass tort lawyers in retreat, it soon became apparent that
Varrick was in hot pursuit. The wars over Rule 11 sanctions would rage for
months.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Ten days after the
verdict, the FDA lifted its recall of Krayoxx, and Varrick flooded the market.
Reuben Massey would quickly restock his cash reserves, and his first priority
was to pound away at the mass tort bar over its mistreatment of his beloved
drug.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Eleven
days after the verdict, and still no word from Aaron Deentz. The Hung Juror had
taken a break from his blog, without an explanation. David had two thoughts
about a prosecution for simple assault. First, if Deentz filed charges, he
would run the risk of blowing his cover. Like many bloggers, he relished his
anonymity and the freedom it allowed to say virtually anything. The fact that
David knew who he was, and called him out right before he punched him, had to
be unsettling. If Deentz pressed charges, he would be forced to appear in court
and admit to being the Hung Juror. If he was really out of work and looking for
a job, his blogging might haunt him. In the past two years, he had said
terrible things about judges, lawyers, and law firms. On the other hand, he had
been on the receiving end of two solid punches. David had not felt bones
breaking, but there had to be damage, if only temporary. Since Deentz was a
lawyer, he would probably insist on getting his day in court, and his revenge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David had yet to
tell Helen about the assault. He knew she would <a name=page369></a>react with
disfavor and she would worry about an arrest and prosecution. His plan was to
tell her only if Deentz filed charges. In other words, he would tell her later,
maybe. Then he had another idea. There was only one Aaron Deentz in the phone
book, and late one afternoon David dialed his number. ¡°Aaron Deentz, please,¡±
David said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Speaking. Who is
this?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°David Zinc, here,
Mr. Deentz, and I¡¯m calling to apologize for my actions after the jury¡¯s
verdict. I was upset, angry, and I acted rashly.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A pause, then, ¡°You
broke my jaw.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>At first, there was
a flash of macho pride in the fact that he could throw a punch with such
ferocity, but all bravado vanished when David thought about a civil lawsuit for
personal injuries. ¡°Again, I apologize, and I certainly did not intend to break
anything or cause bodily harm.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Deentz¡¯s next
response was most revealing. He asked, ¡°How did you learn my identity?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>So, he was afraid
of being exposed. David fudged a little by saying, ¡°I have a cousin who¡¯s a
geek. Took him twenty-four hours. You shouldn¡¯t post at the same time each day.
Sorry about the jaw. I¡¯m willing to cover your medical expenses.¡± He made this
offer because he was compelled to, but he flinched at the thought of another
outlay of cash.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Are you trying to
offer a deal, Zinc?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure. I¡¯ll cover
your medicals, and you agree not to press charges or pursue damages.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re worried
about an assault charge?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not really. If I
have to defend myself for the assault, I¡¯ll make sure the judge sees some of
your comments, and I doubt he¡¯ll be impressed. Judges despise blogs like yours.
Judge Seawright followed it daily and was furious, thought it might affect the
case if any of the jurors stumbled across it. His clerks were trying to learn
the identity of the Hung Juror.¡± David was spinning this wild fiction on the
fly, but it had a legitimate ring to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Have you told
anyone?¡± Deentz asked. David couldn¡¯t tell if he was timid, scared, or just
dealing with a broken jaw.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page370></a><span
lang=EN>¡°Not a soul.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I lost my
insurance when I lost my job. The medicals are $4,600 as of now. The wires are
in for a month, after that I don¡¯t know.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I made my offer,¡±
David said. ¡°Do we have a deal?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A long pause, then,
¡°Yes, I guess.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°There¡¯s one other
thing, Mr. Deentz.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Okay, what is it?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You called my wife
a bimbo.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes, I, uh,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°She is, and she¡¯s
a very smart lady.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°And mine.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Wally¡¯s
first post-trial victory was the successful completion of Oscar¡¯s divorce
settlement. With little in the way of assets and both parties desperately
wanting out, the agreement was actually quite simple, if any legal document
could ever be considered simple. When Oscar and Wally signed their names just
below Paula Finley and Goodloe Stamm, Oscar stared at the signatures for a long
time and did not attempt to suppress a smile. Wally filed the agreement in
circuit court, and an appearance date was set for mid-January.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar insisted on a
celebratory bottle of champagne, nonalcoholic of course, and the firm met at
the table for an unofficial meeting late in the day. Since all four knew the
score&#8212;Day 15 of sobriety&#8212;Wally was toasted along with the newest bachelor on
the block, Oscar Finley. It was Thursday, November 10, and though the little
boutique firm was facing a mountain of debt with few clients, they seemed determined
to enjoy the moment. Wounded and humiliated, they were still standing and
showing signs of life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Just as he drained

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>The facility was one in a long row of modern
warehouses that covered acres and seemed to stretch endlessly west from Des

trouble, and at 10:00 Monday morning he escorted Soe and Lwin Khaing through
the front door of a redbrick office complex stuck to the side of a massive warehouse.

coffee, pastries, and juice were offered. They declined. David¡¯s stomach was

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Three well-dressed
corporate types entered the room: Dylan Kott, chief counsel; Carl LaPorte, CEO;
and Wyatt Vitelli, chief financial officer. Rapid introductions were made, and
then Carl LaPorte asked everyone to have a seat and did his best to reduce the
tension. More offers were made of coffee, juice, and pastries. No thanks. When
it soon became apparent that the Khaings were too intimidated to converse,
LaPorte grew somber and said to the parents, ¡°Well, first things first. I know
you have a very sick boy and he is not likely to improve much. I have a
four-year-old grandson, my only grandchild, and I cannot imagine what you are
going through. On behalf of my company, Sonesta Games, I take full
responsibility for what has happened to your son. We did not make the product,
this Nasty Teeth toy, but we own the smaller company that did import it from
China. Since it¡¯s our company, it is our responsibility. Any questions?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page373></a><span
lang=EN>Lwin and Soe shook their heads slowly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David watched in
amazement. In a trial, these comments by Carl LaPorte would be fair game. An
apology by the company would be admissible into evidence and carry great weight
with the jury. The fact that he was accepting responsibility, and doing it
without hesitation, was important for two reasons: first, the company was
sincere; and, second, the case was not going to trial. The presence of the CEO,
CFO, and top lawyer was a clear sign that they had brought their checkbook.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>LaPorte continued:
¡°Nothing I can say will bring back your little boy. All I can do is say I¡¯m sorry
and promise you that our company will do all that we can to help you.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Thank you,¡± Soe
said as Lwin wiped her eyes. After a long pause, during which LaPorte watched
their faces with great sympathy, he said, ¡°Mr. Zinc, I suggest the parents wait
in another room down the hall while we discuss matters.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Agreed,¡± David
said. An assistant suddenly materialized and led the Khaings away. When the
door was closed again, LaPorte said, ¡°A couple of suggestions. Let¡¯s take off
our coats and try to relax. We could be here for some time. Any objection to
using first names, Mr. Zinc?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not at all.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good. We¡¯re a
California company, and our culture leans to the informal.¡± All coats were
removed and ties loosened. Carl continued, ¡°How would you like to proceed,
David?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You called the
meeting.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Right, so a little
background might be helpful. First, as I¡¯m sure you know, we¡¯re the
third-largest toy company in America, sales last year of just over $3 billion.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Behind Mattel and
Hasbro,¡± David said politely. ¡°I¡¯ve read all your annual reports and a ton of
other stuff. I know your products, history, financials, key personnel,
divisions, and long-term corporate strategy. I know who insures your company,
but of course the limits of liability are not disclosed. I¡¯m happy to sit here
and chat as long as you guys would like to. I have nothing else planned for the
day, and my <a name=page374></a>clients have taken off from work. But to move
things along, I suggest we get down to business.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Carl smiled and
looked at Dylan Kott and Wyatt Vitelli.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sure, we¡¯re all
busy,¡± Carl said. ¡°You¡¯ve done your homework, David, so tell us what you have
in mind.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David slid across
Exhibit 1 and began, ¡°This is a summary of brain damage verdicts over the past
ten years, kids only. Number 1 is a $12 million verdict in New Jersey last year
for a six-year-old who ingested lead by chewing on a plastic action figure. The
case is on appeal. Look at Number 4&#8212;a $9 million verdict in Minnesota that was
upheld on appeal last year. My father sits on the Minnesota Supreme Court and
is fairly conservative when it comes to upholding large verdicts. He voted to
affirm that one, as did the rest of the court. Unanimous. It was another
lead-poisoning case&#8212;a kid and his toy. Number 7 involves a nine-year-old girl
who nearly drowned when her foot got caught in the drain of a brand-new
swimming pool at a country club in Springfield, Illinois. Jury deliberated less
than an hour and awarded the family $9 million. On page 2, look at Number 13. A
ten-year-old boy was hit with a piece of metal flung from a commercial Bush Hog
with no chain guards. Severe brain damage. The case was tried in federal court
in Chicago, and the jury awarded $5 million in actual damages and $20 million
in punitive damages. The punitive award was cut to $5 million on appeal. I
don¡¯t need to go through every case, and I¡¯m sure you guys are familiar with
this territory.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It should be
obvious, David, that we would like to avoid a trial and jury.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I understand, but
my point is that this case has tremendous jury appeal. After the jurors spend
three days looking at Thuya Khaing strapped into his high chair, they might
bring back a verdict larger than any of these. That potential should be
factored into our negotiations.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Got it. What is
your demand?¡± Carl asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, a settlement
should include several areas of compensation, some relatively easy to tally,
others not so easy. Let¡¯s start with the <a name=page375></a>financial burden
on the family to care for the child. As of now, they¡¯re spending about $600 a
month on food, medications, and diapers. Not much money, but a lot more than
the family can afford. The boy needs a part-time nurse and a full-time rehab
specialist to at least attempt to retrain muscles and reprogram the brain.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What¡¯s his life
expectancy?¡± asked Wyatt Vitelli.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No one knows. It¡¯s
a moving target. I didn¡¯t put it in my report, because one doctor says a year
or two, off the record, and another one says he could live to be an adult. I¡¯ve
talked to all the doctors, and no one thinks it¡¯s smart to predict how long he
might live. I¡¯ve spent some time with him during the past six months, and I¡¯ve
noticed a slight improvement in some functions, very slight. I think we should
negotiate as if he has twenty years left.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>All three men
nodded, quick to agree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°It¡¯s obvious that
his parents do not earn a lot of money. They live in a small, cheap apartment
with two older daughters. The family needs a home, with plenty of space and a
bedroom outfitted for Thuya¡¯s special needs. Nothing elaborate&#8212;these are simple
people, but they have dreams.¡± At this point, David slid across three copies of
Exhibit 2, which were quickly snatched off the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David took a deep
breath and plowed forward. ¡°This is our settlement proposal. First, you see the
specific damages. Number 1 covers the expenses I mentioned, plus a part-time
nurse at $30,000 a year, plus the mother¡¯s lost salary of $25,000 a year
because she would like to quit work and stay home with the boy. I¡¯ve also added
the cost of a new car so they can take him to and from rehab on a daily basis.
I¡¯ve rounded it off to $100,000 a year, for twenty years, for a total of $2
million. You can buy an annuity at today¡¯s rates for $1.4 million. Rehab is a
gray area because I¡¯m not sure how long it would continue. As of today, it runs
about $50,000 a year. Assuming twenty years, the annuity will cost you
$700,000. Next is the issue of a new home, in a nice neighborhood, with good
schools&#8212;$500,000. The next item deals with the Lakeshore Children¡¯s Hospital.
Their care saved his life <a name=page376></a>and was free, at least to the
family, but I think the expenses should be paid back. The hospital was
reluctant to give me an estimate, but there it is&#8212;$600,000.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David was at $3.2
million, and none of the three executives had removed a pen from a pocket.
There were no frowns, no head shaking; nothing to indicate they thought he¡¯d
lost his mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Moving on to the
nonspecifics, I¡¯ve listed the kid¡¯s loss of enjoyment of life and the emotional
distress of the family. I know these are vague areas, but they are compensable
damages under Illinois law. I suggest the sum of $1.8 million.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David folded his
hands together and waited on a response. No one seemed surprised.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A tidy sum of $5
million,¡± Carl LaPorte said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What about
attorneys¡¯ fees?¡± Dylan Kott asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Gee, almost forgot
about those,¡± David said and everyone smiled. ¡°My fee is not taken from what
the family gets. It¡¯s extra. Thirty percent on top of what you¡¯re looking at
there, or $1.5 million.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s a nice
payday,¡± Dylan said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David almost
mentioned the millions each of the three had earned the previous year in salary
and stock options, but let it pass. ¡°I would like to think I could keep it all,
but that will not be the case.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Six and a half
million dollars,¡± Carl said as he laid down his copy of the report and
stretched his arms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You guys seem
intent on doing what¡¯s right,¡± David said. ¡°Plus, you don¡¯t want bad publicity,
just like you don¡¯t want to roll the dice with an unsympathetic jury.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Our image is very
important,¡± Carl said. ¡°We don¡¯t pollute rivers or make cheap handguns or deny
insurance claims or bilk the government on bad contracts. We make toys for
kids. It¡¯s just that simple. If we get the reputation for harming children,
we¡¯re dead.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Can I ask where
you found these products?¡± Dylan asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David told the
story of Soe Khaing purchasing the first set of Nasty Teeth a year earlier, and
of his search high and low in Greater Chicago for similar packages. Carl
described the company¡¯s efforts to track them <a name=page377></a>down too and
admitted that Sonesta Games had settled two other similar cases within the past
eighteen months. They were cautiously hopeful that all lead-painted samples had
been removed from the market and destroyed, but not certain. They were at war
with several factories in China and had moved most of their production to other
countries. The purchase of Gunderson Toys had been a costly blunder. Other
stories followed, as if both sides needed a break to think about the settlement
proposal on the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After an hour, they
asked David to step outside so they could huddle in private.</span></p>

<p class=Para01 style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David
drank a cup of coffee with his clients, and after fifteen minutes the same
assistant asked him to return to the conference room. She closed the door
behind him, and David was ready to cut the deal or walk away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When they were
situated and poised, Carl LaPorte said, ¡°We were prepared to write a check for
$5 million and put this matter to rest, David, but you¡¯re asking for a lot more
than that.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°We will not accept
$5 million, because the case is worth twice that much. Our number is $6.5
million, take it or leave it. I¡¯ll file the lawsuit tomorrow.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A lawsuit will
take years. Can your clients afford to wait?¡± Dylan asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Some of our
federal judges use this Local Rule 83:19, nicknamed the Rocket Docket, and
believe me, it works. I can have this case before a jury in a year. The last
case was far more complicated, and it went to trial ten months after it was
filed. Yes, my clients can survive until the jury brings back the verdict.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You didn¡¯t win
that case, did you?¡± Carl asked with his eyebrows arched, as if he knew
everything about the Klopeck trial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No, I did not, but
I learned a lot. I had a lousy set of facts. This time, I own the facts. By the
time the jury hears everything, $6.5 million will seem like a bargain.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page378></a><span
lang=EN>¡°We¡¯ll offer $5 million.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David swallowed
hard, glared at Carl LaPorte, and said, ¡°You¡¯re not hearing me, Carl. It¡¯s $6.5
million now, or a lot more a year from now.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You¡¯re turning
down $5 million for these poor Burmese immigrants?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I just turned it
down, and I¡¯m not negotiating. Your company is well insured. The $6.5 million
is not coming off your bottom line.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Maybe, but the
insurance premiums are not cheap.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m not haggling,
Carl. Deal or no deal?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Carl took a deep
breath and exchanged looks with Dylan Kott and Wyatt Vitelli. Then he shrugged,
smiled, surrendered, and offered a hand. ¡°A deal.¡± David grabbed his hand and
shook it firmly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°On the condition
that this is extremely confidential,¡± Carl said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Of course.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Dylan said, ¡°I¡¯ll
get our guys in Legal to prepare an agreement.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Not necessary,¡±
David said as he reached into his briefcase. He pulled out a file, removed four
copies of a document, and passed them around. ¡°This is a settlement agreement
that covers everything. It¡¯s pretty straightforward and includes all manner of
language about confidentiality. I work for a tiny law firm, but it has some
complicated problems. It¡¯s in my best interests to keep this quiet.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You had a
settlement agreement prepared at $6.5 million?¡± Carl asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You got it. Not a
penny less. That¡¯s what this case is worth.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Dylan said, ¡°This
settlement has to be approved by the court, right?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes. I¡¯ve already
established a guardianship for the kid; his father is his legal representative.
The court must approve the settlement, and over the years it will supervise the
money. I¡¯m required to prepare an annual accounting and meet with the judge
once a year, but the file can be sealed to ensure secrecy.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>They reviewed the
agreement, then Carl LaPorte signed it on behalf of his company. David signed
it, then Soe and Lwin were brought into <a name=page379></a>the room. David
explained the terms of the settlement to them, and they signed under his name.
Carl apologized again and wished them well. They were shell-shocked, overcome
with emotion, and unable to speak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As they were
leaving the building, Dylan Kott asked David if he could have a moment to
discuss a matter. The Khaings moved on and waited by David¡¯s SUV. Dylan deftly
slid a white unmarked envelope into David¡¯s hand as he said, ¡°You didn¡¯t get
this from me, okay?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David placed it
inside his coat pocket. ¡°What is it?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°A list of other
products, mainly toys, with histories of lead poisoning. Most were made in
China, but there are some from Mexico, Vietnam, and Pakistan. Made somewhere
else, but imported here by U.S. companies.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I see. And might
these companies be your competitors?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°You got it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Finley &amp; Figg¡¯s last firm meeting took place
late that afternoon. At David¡¯s insistence, they waited until Rochelle was
gone. Oscar was exhausted and cranky, a good sign. His girlfriend and driver
had been sent away at 3:00 p.m., and David promised to drive his senior partner
home after the meeting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°This must be
important,¡± Wally said as David locked the front door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Indeed it is,¡± he
said, taking a seat at the table. ¡°You guys remember that lead-poisoning case I
mentioned back a few months ago?¡± There were vague recollections, but so much
had happened since then. ¡°Well,¡± David said smugly, ¡°there has been an
interesting development.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Do tell,¡± Wally
said, already anticipating something pleasant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David went through
a lengthy narrative of his activities on behalf of the Khaings. He placed a set
of Nasty Teeth on the table as he slowly spun his story toward its delightful
climax. ¡°This morning, I met with the CEO and other top executives from the
company, and we reached a settlement.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>By this time, Wally
and Oscar were hanging on every word and exchanging nervous glances. When David
said, ¡°The attorneys¡¯ fees are $1.5 million,¡± both closed their eyes and
lowered their heads, as if in prayer. David paused as he retrieved copies of a
document for each of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°This is a proposed
partnership agreement for the new law firm of <a name=page381></a>Finley, Figg
&amp; Zinc.¡± Oscar and Wally held the document, but neither looked at its
language. They simply gawked at David, both mouths open, both men too stunned
to speak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David continued,
¡°An equal partnership, a three-way split of the bottom line with a monthly draw
based on net revenue for each month. You guys keep the building in your names.
You may want to look at the third paragraph on the second page.¡± Neither
flipped a page.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Just tell us,¡±
Oscar said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Okay, there¡¯s some
pretty clear language about certain activities the new firm will not engage in.
It will not pay bribes or referral fees to policemen, tow truck drivers, rescue
personnel, or anyone else for case referrals. It will not advertise on bus stop
benches, bingo cards, or any other cheap publication. In fact, all advertising
must be approved by the Marketing Committee, which, at least for the first
year, will consist solely of me. In other words, fellas, the firm will no
longer chase ambulances.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What¡¯s the fun of
that?¡± Wally asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David smiled
politely but kept going. ¡°I¡¯ve heard talk about advertising on billboards and
television; that, too, is prohibited. Before the firm signs up a new client,
the three of us must agree to take the case. In summary, the firm will adhere
to the highest standards of professional conduct. Any fees in cash will go
straight to the books, which will now be kept by a competent CPA. In effect,
gentlemen, the new firm will operate like a real law firm. This agreement is
good for one year, and if either of you fails to comply with it, then the
partnership will dissolve and I¡¯ll find work elsewhere.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Back to the
attorneys¡¯ fees,¡± Wally said. ¡°I¡¯m not sure you finished that part of the
discussion.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°If we can agree on
the rules of the new partnership, then I suggest we use the fees from the Khaing
settlement to pay off the bank and clean up the Krayoxx mess, including the
$15,000 in sanctions levied during the trial. That¡¯s about $200,000. Rochelle
gets a bonus of $100,000. That leaves $1.2 million for the lawyers, which I
think we should divide equally.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page382></a><span
lang=EN>Wally closed his eyes. Oscar grunted, then slowly got to his feet and
walked to the front door, where he looked through the window. Finally, he said,
¡°You don¡¯t have to do this, David.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I agree,¡± Wally

David said. ¡°But I look at it like this: I would never have found this case had
I not been here. It¡¯s that simple. A year ago, I was working at a job I hated.
By chance I stumbled into this place, met you guys, and then I got lucky and
found this case.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Excellent point,¡±
Wally said, and Oscar was quick to agree. Oscar walked back to the table and
slowly settled into his chair. He looked at Wally and said, ¡°What about my
divorce?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No problem. We
have a signed settlement agreement. Your wife is not entitled to any fees
earned after she signed it. The divorce will be final in January.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°That¡¯s the way I
see it,¡± Oscar said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Me too,¡± added
David.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Things were silent
for a long time, then AC rose from his pillow and began a low growl. The
distant whine of an ambulance siren came into range and grew louder. Wally
glanced longingly at the window beside Rochelle¡¯s desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Don¡¯t even think
about it,¡± David said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Sorry. Force of

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>Bart Shaw closed his files and dropped his
malpractice threats against Finley &amp; Figg. He collected almost $80,000 from
Varrick for his successful efforts to torment the firm and force it to trial in
the Klopeck matter. Adam Grand filed an ethics complaint with the state bar
association, but it eventually fizzled. Five other clients, of the ¡°non-death¡±
variety, did the same, with the same results. Nadine Karros made good on her
promise not to seek sanctions for the filing of frivolous lawsuits, but Varrick
mounted an aggressive, and sometimes successful, campaign in other courts to
collect money from plaintiffs¡¯ firms. Jerry Alisandros was hit with a huge fine
in southern Florida when it became obvious he had no plans to pursue his
Krayoxx litigation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Thuya Khaing
suffered a series of violent seizures and died three days after Christmas in
Lakeshore Children¡¯s Hospital. David and Helen, along with Wally, Oscar, and
Rochelle, attended the small burial service. Also in attendance were Carl
LaPorte and Dylan Kott, who, with David¡¯s help, managed to have a quiet word
with Soe and Lwin. Carl offered his heartfelt condolences and again took full
responsibility on behalf of his company. Under the terms of David¡¯s settlement
agreement, all sums were vested and would be paid as promised.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Oscar¡¯s divorce
became final in late January. By then, he was living with his new girlfriend in
a new apartment and had never been happier. Wally remained sober and was even
volunteering to help with other lawyers battling addictions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><a name=page384></a><span
lang=EN>Justin Bardall was sentenced to one year in prison for attempting to
torch the law office. He appeared in court in a wheelchair and was required by
the judge to acknowledge the presence of Oscar, Wally, and David. Bardall had
cooperated with the prosecutors for a light sentence. The judge, who had spent
the first twenty years of his career practicing law on the streets of southwest
Chicago and had a low opinion of thugs who conspired to burn law offices, did
not show compassion for Justin¡¯s bosses. The owner of Cicero Pipe was sentenced
to five years in prison, and his construction superintendent got four.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David successfully
won a dismissal of Bardall¡¯s lawsuit against Oscar and the firm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Not surprisingly,
the new partnership did not survive. After his heart surgery and divorce, Oscar
lost steam and spent fewer hours at the office. He had some money in the bank
and was drawing a pension from Social Security, and his housemate made a
comfortable living as a masseuse. (He had actually met her next door.) After
six months under the new agreement, he began dropping hints about retiring.
Wally was still smarting from his Krayoxx adventure and had lost his zeal to
hustle new cases. He, too, had a new girlfriend, a slightly older woman with a
¡°nice balance sheet,¡± as he described it. Also, it was painfully obvious, at
least to David, that neither partner had the desire, nor talent, to put
together big cases and take them to trial if necessary. He honestly couldn¡¯t
imagine walking into another courtroom with those two.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>His radar was on
high alert, and he saw the warning signs immediately. He began planning his
exit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Eleven months after
Emma arrived, Helen gave birth to twin boys. That momentous occasion prompted
David to plan a new future. He leased office space not far from their home in
Lincoln Park, carefully choosing a fourth-floor suite with a view to the south.
He could see the magnificent skyline of downtown, with the Trust Tower squarely
in the center of it. The view never failed to motivate him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>When things were in
place, he informed Oscar and Wally that he planned to leave when the agreement
expired at the end of twelve <a name=page385></a>months. The parting was
difficult and sad, but not unexpected. It prompted Oscar to announce his
retirement. Wally seemed relieved too. He and Oscar decided on the spot to sell
the building and close shop. By the time all three shook hands and wished each
other good luck, Wally was planning a getaway to Alaska.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>David got the dog,
and he also got Rochelle, though the two had been in secret talks for a month.
He would never consider hiring her away from the firm, but suddenly she was a
free agent. With a higher salary and more benefits, she was given the title of
office manager and happily moved into the new digs of David E. Zinc,
Attorney-at-Law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The new firm
specialized in product liability law. When David settled two more
lead-poisoning cases, it was clear to him and Rochelle and their expanding
staff that the practice was about to become quite lucrative.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Most of his work
was in federal court, and as business boomed, he found himself downtown more
and more. When possible, he stopped by Abner¡¯s for a laugh and a quick lunch&#8212;a
sandwich and a diet soda. On two occasions he had a Pearl Harbor with Miss
Spence, who, though pushing ninety-seven, still knocked back three of the
syrupy concoctions every day. David could choke down only one, and afterward he
took the train back to the office and enjoyed a nap on his new sofa.</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>The tumor in my father¡¯s pancreas was removed
last week in an operation that lasted five hours and was more difficult than
his surgeons had expected. Afterward, they delivered the grim news that most
people in his condition could not expect to live for more than ninety days.
Since I knew nothing of the surgery, or the tumor, I was not there when he was
given his death sentence. Communication is not a priority with my father. Ten
years ago he divorced one wife and had found another before word filtered down
to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>His current
wife&#8212;she¡¯s either number five or number six&#8212;eventually called and, after
reintroducing herself, passed along the barest of details about the tumor and
its related issues. Agnes explained that my father was not feeling well and
didn¡¯t want to talk. I replied that he had never wanted to talk, regardless of
how he felt. She asked me to spread the news to the rest of the family. I
almost asked ¡°Why?¡± but didn¡¯t want to bicker with this poor woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The rest of the
family consists of my younger sister, Jill, and my mother. Jill lives in
Seattle and, as far as I know, has not spoken to our father in at least ten
years. She has two small children who have never met him, and never will. My
mother, after surviving twelve years of marriage, got lucky and got out, taking
Jill and me with her, and I have a hunch that the news of his impending death
will have zero impact on her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Needless to say, we
do not get together at Christmas and exchange gifts by the fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After the phone
call from Agnes, I sit at my desk and ponder life without Warren, my father. I
started calling him Warren when I was in college because he was more of a
person, a stranger, than a father. He did not object. He has never cared what I
call him, and I have always assumed he prefers that I don¡¯t call him at all. At
least I make the occasional effort; he never has.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>After a few
minutes, I admit the truth&#8212;life without Warren will be the same as life with
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>I call Jill and
break the news. Her first question is whether I plan to attend the funeral,
which is somewhat premature. She wants to know if she should try to visit him,
to say hello and good-bye and go through the phony motions of acting as though
she cares, when in fact she does not. Nor do I, and we both admit this. We have
no love for Warren because he never cared for us. He abandoned the family when
we were kids and has spent the past thirty years acting as though we do not
exist. Jill and I are both parents now, and we find it inconceivable that a
father can have no use for his own children.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m not going,¡±
she finally declares. ¡°Now, or later. How about you?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t know,¡± I
reply. ¡°I¡¯ll have to think about it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The truth is that I
know I will go see him. He has burned most of the bridges in his life, but
there is one rather substantial piece of unfinished business that he has to
deal with before he dies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>My mother lives in
Tulsa with her second husband. In high school, Warren was the superjock, and
she was the homecoming queen, the most popular girl. Their wedding thrilled
their small town, but after a couple of years with Warren all thrills were
gone. I know they have not spoken to each other in decades, and why should
they?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Mom, I have some
bad news,¡± I say into the phone, trying to seem sufficiently somber.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°What is it?¡± she
asks quickly, probably afraid it is one of her grandchildren.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Warren¡¯s sick.
Pancreatic cancer, he has less than three months to live.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A pause, relief,
then, ¡°I was assuming he was already dead.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>And there you have
it. His memorial service will not be packed with grieving family members.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I¡¯m sorry,¡± she
says, but she is not. ¡°I guess you¡¯ll have to deal with it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I suppose.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I don¡¯t want to be
bothered with it, Paul, just call me when it¡¯s over. Or don¡¯t. I don¡¯t care
what happens to Warren.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I understand,
Mom.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>I know he hit her a
few times, probably a lot more than I realized. And he drank and chased women
and lived the hard life of a professional baseball player. He was arrogant and
cocky, and from the age of fifteen he was accustomed to getting whatever he
wanted because he, Warren Tracey, could throw a baseball through a brick wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>We manage to move
the conversation to the kids and when she might see them again. Because of her
beauty and brains, she landed on her feet after Warren. She married a slightly
older man, an executive for a drilling company, and he provided a fine home for
Jill and me. He loves my mom, and that¡¯s all that matters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>I doubt if Warren
ever did.</span></p>

<p class=Para02><span lang=EN>In the summer of 1973, the country was slowly
emerging from the trauma of Vietnam. Spiro Agnew was in trouble and would
eventually go down. Watergate was getting hot with much more to come. I was
eleven years old and slightly aware of what was happening out there in the real
world, but I was wonderfully unburdened by it. Baseball was my world, and
little else mattered. My father pitched for the New York Mets, and I lived and
died with each game. I pitched too, for the Scrappers in the White Plains
Little League, and because my father was who he was, great things were expected
of me. I rarely met those expectations, but there were moments of promise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>By early July, the
pennant race in the National League East had settled into a bland contest. All
six teams&#8212;Mets, Pirates, Cardinals, Phillies, Cubs, and Expos&#8212;were hovering
around .500 and showing little enthusiasm for making a run. In the West, the
Reds and the Dodgers were pulling away. In the American League, the Oakland
A¡¯s, with their swagger and colorful uniforms and long hair, were looking to
repeat their championship of 1972.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>My buddies and I
followed the game religiously. We knew each player and every statistic. We
checked every box score, then replayed the games on the sandlots of White
Plains. Life at home was not always pleasant, and my escape was on the field.
Baseball was my best friend, and in mid-July 1973 the game was about to be
electrified like never before.</span></p>

<p class=Para08 style='margin-top:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>It began quietly enough
with a pulled hamstring. The first baseman for the Cubs AAA affiliate in
Wichita went down as he rounded third and headed for home. The next day, Jim
Hickman, the first baseman for the Cubs, injured his back. The team suddenly
needed someone to play first, so they reached down to their AA club in Midland,
Texas, and called up a twenty-one-year-old named Joe Castle. At the time,
Castle was hitting .395 with twenty home runs, fifty RBIs, forty stolen bases,
and only one error at first base. He was the hottest player in AA and was
creating a buzz.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>As the story goes,
Castle was asleep in the cheap apartment he shared with four other minor
leaguers when the call came from Chicago. An assistant coach drove him to the
airport in Midland, and he caught a flight to Houston, where he waited two
hours for a flight to Philadelphia. While he waited, he called his family in
Arkansas with the thrilling news. When he arrived in Philadelphia, a cab
delivered him to Veterans Stadium, where he was quickly fitted for a uniform,
given Number 42, and hustled onto the field. The Cubs were already taking
batting practice. Understandably, he was nervous, thrilled, almost bewildered,
and when the manager, Whitey Lockman, said, ¡°Get loose. You¡¯re starting at
first and hitting seventh,¡± Castle had trouble gripping his brand-new bat. In
his first round of major-league batting practice, he swung at the first two
pitches and missed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He would not miss
again for a long time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In the dugout
before the game, he huddled with Don Kessinger, the Cubs veteran shortstop and
another Arkansas boy. Kessinger had been an all-American in baseball and
basketball at Ole Miss and was outgoing and laid back. He managed to keep the
kid loose. His only advice was ¡°Go up there swinging.¡± The Cubs center fielder
was Rick Monday, another veteran who had been born in Batesville, Arkansas,
just down the White River from Joe¡¯s hometown. Between Kessinger and Monday,
Joe managed to survive the worst case of pregame jitters a player could
imagine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>It was Thursday,
July 12, a day baseball would remember for a long time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The Phillies
pitcher was a lefty, Benny Humphries, a wild fastballer who walked as many as
he struck out. As Joe strolled to the plate in the second inning, he gritted
his teeth and again told himself to swing at the first pitch, wherever it
happened to be. Humphries thought the rookie should get introduced to
major-league heat and unloaded everything he had. Joe, from the right side,
guessed fastball, made perfect contact, and hit a shot that landed twenty rows
back in left center field. He sprinted around the bases, much too excited for
any kind of victory trot, and was in the dugout being congratulated before he
caught his breath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He was not the
first major leaguer to homer on the first pitch he saw. In fact, he was the
eleventh. Forty-six homered in their first at bat, eleven on the first pitch.
Nonetheless, his name was in the record book. It was now open, and Joe Castle
wasn¡¯t finished with it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>In the fifth
inning, Humphries started off with a fastball high and tight, a brushback meant
as a warning, but Joe didn¡¯t get the message. He worked the count to 3 and 1,
then yanked a fastball down the left field line, where it barely scraped the
inside of the foul pole. The third base umpire was quick to twirl his right
index finger signaling a home run. Joe, who was rounding first and following
the ball, kicked into a sprint and slowed slightly as he neared home plate. Now
a record belonged only to him and one other. In 1951, Bob Nieman of the St.
Louis Browns homered in his first two major-league at bats.</span></p>

<p class=Para08 style='margin-top:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>The Mets were playing
the Braves in Atlanta that night, and the game was not on television. I was in
Tom Sabbatini¡¯s basement listening to Lindsey Nelson, the Mets¡¯ wonderful
play-by-play announcer, who informed us of what had just happened in
Philadelphia. It didn¡¯t take much to get Lindsey excited. ¡°He tied a record,
folks,¡± he said. ¡°Think of the thousands of young men who¡¯ve played this game,
and only two have homered in their first two at bats.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I wonder if he can
do it three times,¡± added Ralph Kiner, the Hall of Fame slugger and Lindsey¡¯s
sidekick.</span></p>

<p class=Para08 style='margin-top:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>The Cubs chased
Humphries in the sixth, and the Phillies brought in a middle reliever, a
right-hander named Tip Gallagher. When Joe left the on-deck circle in the top
of the seventh, the score was tied 4&#8211;4, and the Phillies fans, always vocal,
were silent. There was no applause, just curiosity. To their surprise, Joe dug
in from the left side. Since there was no scouting report, the Phillies did not
know he was a switch-hitter. No one had bothered to notice him during batting
practice. He looked at a curveball low, then fouled off the next two fastballs.
With two strikes, he shortened his stance and choked up three inches on the
bat. The previous season, he led the Texas League with the lowest strike-out
percentage of any hitter. Joe Castle was at his most dangerous with two
strikes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>A slider missed
low, then Gallagher came with a fastball away. Joe went with the pitch and
slapped it hard to left center, a line drive that kept rising until it cleared
the wall by five feet. As he circled the bases for the third consecutive time,
he did so with a record that seemed untouchable. No rookie had ever homered in
his first three at bats.</span></p>

<p class=Para08 style='margin-top:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>Joe Castle was from
Calico Rock, Arkansas, a tiny, picturesque village on a bluff above the White
River, on the eastern edge of the Ozark Mountains. It was Cardinals country,
and had been since the days of Dizzy Dean, an Arkansas farm boy and leader of
the infamous Gashouse Gang in the 1930s. His brother Paul, nicknamed Daffy, was
also a pitcher on the same team. In 1934, at the height of the Gang¡¯s fame,
Dizzy predicted in spring training that he and Daffy would combine for fifty
wins. They won forty-nine&#8212;thirty for Dizzy and nineteen for Daffy. Twenty years
later, Stan Musial, the greatest Cardinal of all, was revered to the point of
being worshipped. With a radio on every front porch, the town, like countless
others in the Midwest and the Deep South, followed the beloved Cardinals with a
passion during the long, hot summer nights. KMOX out of St. Louis carried the
games, and the familiar voices of Harry Caray and Jack Buck could be heard on
every street and in every car.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>On July 12, though,
the dials in Calico Rock had been switched to WGN out of Chicago, and Joe¡¯s
friends and family were hanging on every pitch. The Cardinals&#8211;Cubs rivalry was
the greatest in the National League, and though many in Calico Rock found it
difficult to believe they were rooting for the hated Cubs, they were suddenly
doing so, and with a fervor. In a matter of hours, they had been converted to
Cubs fans. After the first home run, a crowd quickly gathered outside Evans
Drug Store on Main Street. The second home run sent them into a giddy
celebration, and the crowd continued to grow. When Joe¡¯s parents, two brothers,
their wives, and their small children showed up to join the party, they were
greeted with bear hugs and cheers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The third home run
sent the entire town into orbit. They were also celebrating in the streets and
pubs of Chicago.</span></p>

<p class=Para08 style='margin-top:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>As stunning as his
first three at bats had been, Joe¡¯s fourth would endear him to baseball purists
forever. Top of the ninth, score tied 6&#8211;6, two outs, Don Kessinger standing on
third, a tough right-hander named Ed Ramon on the mound. As Joe stepped to the
plate, a few of the eighteen thousand fans clapped politely, then an odd
silence settled across Veterans Stadium. Ramon¡¯s first pitch was a fastball on
the outside part of the plate. Joe waited, then whipped his bat like a
broomstick, crushing the ball and lining it a few inches outside the bag at
first base, a foul ball, but an impressive one nonetheless. Ernie Banks, the
Cubs first base coach, did not have time to react, and if the ball had hit him,
he would have been seriously maimed. Willie Montanez, the Phillies first
baseman, moved to his left, but only after the ball had caromed off the stands
and was rolling into right field. Instinctively, Montanez took two steps back.
Joe noticed this and changed his plans. The second pitch was a changeup, high.
With the count 1 and 1, Ramon tried another fastball. As soon as he released
it, Joe hesitated a split second, then broke for first base with his bat
trailing. It tapped the ball slightly and sent it dribbling toward the second
baseman, Denny Doyle, who was as startled as Ramon, Montanez, and everyone else
in the stadium. By the time Doyle got to the ball, or the ball got to Doyle,
Joe was ten feet past first base and slowing down along the right field foul
line. Kessinger walked home with the eventual winning run. The crowd sat in
stunned silence. Players from both teams looked on in disbelief. With a chance
to hit four home runs in a game&#8212;a feat baseball had seen only nine times in a
hundred years&#8212;the kid chose instead to lay down a perfect drag bunt to score
the go-ahead run.</span></p>

<p class=Para08 style='margin-top:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>Most of those listening
to the game along Main Street in Calico Rock had seen the identical drag bunt,
though Joe Castle had seldom needed it. They had seen far more tape-measure
shots and inside-the-park home runs. His oldest brother, Charlie, who was
sitting on a bench outside the drugstore, had taught him the drag bunt when he
was ten years old. He¡¯d also taught him to switch-hit, steal bases, and foul
off pitches that were close but not what he wanted. The middle brother, Red,
had hit him a million ground balls and perfected his footwork at first base.
Both brothers had taught him how to fight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Why¡¯d he bunt?¡±
someone in the crowd asked Charlie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°To score the run
and take the lead,¡± Charlie replied. Plain and simple.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The Cubs
announcers, Vince Lloyd and Lou Boudreau, had been plowing through the record
book during the game and were certain that they had their facts straight. Three
home runs in the first game of a career was a first. Four consecutive hits in a
first game tied a modern-day record, though some rookie had five hits back in
1894.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Chicago won 7&#8211;6,
and by the time the game ended, virtually every Cubs fan was tuned in. History
had been made, and they didn¡¯t want to miss it. Lou Boudreau promised his
listeners that he would soon have Joe wired up for a postgame interview.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>The crowd in Calico
Rock continued to grow, and the mood was rowdy, the pride palpable. A half hour
after the game was over, Lou Boudreau¡¯s voice came across the radio with ¡°I¡¯m
in the visitors¡¯ locker room with Joe Castle, who, as you might guess, is
surrounded by reporters. Here he is.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Sudden silence on
Main Street in Calico Rock; no one moved or spoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Joe, not a bad
first game. What are you thinking right now?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, I would like
to say hello to my family and friends back home in Calico Rock. I wish you
could be here. I still can¡¯t believe it.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Joe, what were you
thinking when you stepped to the plate in the second inning?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I was thinking
fastball and I was swinging at the first pitch. Got lucky, I guess.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°No player has ever
homered in his first three at bats. You¡¯re in the record book.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I guess. I¡¯m just
happy to be here. This time last night I was playing in Midland, Texas. Still
hard to believe.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Indeed it is. I
gotta ask you&#8212;and I know you¡¯ve already been hit with this&#8212;but what were you
thinking in the ninth inning? You had a chance to hit four home runs in a game,
yet you bunted.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I was thinking
about one thing&#8212;getting Don home from third for the go-ahead run. I love
playing baseball, but it¡¯s no fun if you¡¯re not winning.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Well, you got a
nice little streak going here. Think you can keep it up tomorrow night?¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°I haven¡¯t thought
about tomorrow night. Don and some of the guys are taking me out for a steak,
and I¡¯m sure we¡¯ll discuss it then.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Good luck.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>¡°Yes sir. Thank
you.¡±</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>Few in Calico Rock
went to bed before midnight.</span></p>

<p class=Para08 style='margin-top:24.0pt'><span lang=EN>As promised, my mother
awakened me at 6:00 a.m. so I could watch the early morning New York news
programs. I was hoping for a glimpse of Joe Castle. Channel 4 did a quick
rundown on the National League games. The Mets had won in Atlanta to put them
two games over .500. Then there was Joe Castle sprinting around the bases in
Philadelphia, once, twice, three times. The drag bunt, though, got as much
airtime as the three home runs. The guy could fly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>My mother brought
in the <span class=0Text>New York Times</span> from the driveway. On the front
page of the sports section was a black-and-white photo of Joe Castle and a long
story about his historic debut. I found the scissors, cut it out, and started a
new scrapbook, one of many I meticulously maintained. When the Mets were in
town and my father was home, I was forced to save the newspapers for a few days
before clipping the baseball stories.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>I loved it when the
Mets were on the road. My father was gone, and our house was peaceful and
pleasant. When he was around, though, the mood was far different. He was a
self-absorbed, brooding man with seldom a kind word for any of us. He had never
met his potential, and this was always the fault of someone else&#8212;the manager,
his teammates, the owners, even the umpires. On the nights after he pitched, he
often came home late and drunk, and that¡¯s when the trouble started. I
suspected, even at the age of eleven, that my parents would not stay together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>He rarely called
home when the Mets were away. I often thought how wonderful it would be for my
father to check in after a game and talk baseball with me. I watched or
listened to every Mets game and had a dozen questions, but I guess he was too
busy going out with the boys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:12.0pt'><span lang=EN>For me, baseball
was a joy to play when my father wasn¡¯t watching. Because of his schedule, he
rarely had the chance to see my games, and that was an indescribable relief.
When he was there, though, I had no desire to play. He would lecture me on the
way to the park, snarl at me during the game, and, worst of all, berate me all
the way home. He even slapped me once as soon as we were driving away from the
field. From the age of seven, I cried after every game my father saw me play.</span></p>
